<small>POPPY’S PICKLE PARLOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Poppy Ott jumps into a thing he usually
knows where he’s going to land. For he’s a pretty
smart boy for his age, as you probably will agree
with me if you have read the earlier books that I
have written about him. But, bu-lieve me, his wits
sure were tangled up the day he got that “Pickle
Parlor” idea! Or, at least, that is what I told him
when he first sprung his brilliant little scheme on
me.</p>

<p>In arguing with him, to bring him down to
earth as it were, I tried to convince him that a
Pickle Parlor was about as sensible as a barber
shop for hairless poodles. No one, I said, referring
to the people who bought groceries, would buy their
sugar and other truck in one store and then walk
a block to buy their pickles in a pickle store.
That would be just extra work for them.</p>

<p>“They will,” says he, sticking to his scheme, “if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
we have better pickles to sell them than they can
buy in the average grocery store.”</p>

<p>“Pickles is pickles,” says I.</p>

<p>“Like almost everything else,” says he, as solemn
and wise as an old owl, “there’s a big difference
in pickles.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says I, “some are sweet and some are
sour.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” says he, “that of pickles of a kind
some are much better than others. Take your own
mother’s pickles for example. You must have noticed
that they’ve got a better taste than boughten
pickles. And that largely explains why a great
many women prefer to make their own pickles.
They want better pickles than they can buy. So
how easy for us to build up our new business if we
get the right kind of pickles to sell!”</p>

<p>I gave him a sad look.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” I sighed, “you’re too much for me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“As long as you’re a boy,” I advised, as a further
effort to pull him down to earth, “why don’t you be
a boy? This Peanut Parlor stuff is out of your
line, kid.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about a Peanut Parlor.”</p>

<p>“Well, a Pickle Parlor is just as crazy. You can’t
make it work. For pickles are groceries. And the
place to buy them is in a grocery store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Jerry, if you wanted to buy a good cheap stove
poker, what store would you go to?”</p>

<p>“To the Stove-poker Parlor,” says I, tickled over
my own smartness.</p>

<p>“Be serious.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I complied generously, “I might try the
ten-cent store.”</p>

<p>“But a stove poker is <i>hardware</i>. So, if your
argument holds good, ought you not to go to a
hardware store?”</p>

<p>“Tra-la-la,” says I. “Isn’t it a beautiful day.”</p>

<p>“The point is,” says he, “that people will buy
hardware in a novelty store, or, for that matter,
anything in any kind of a store, if you make it an
object for them to do so.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” says I, yawning, “running a store is
a man’s job. So that lets us out.”</p>

<p>But he was as unmoved as though he were the
hill of Gibraltar itself, or whatever you call it.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he reflected, referring to the suggested
partnership, “it will be a fifty-fifty proposition.”</p>

<p>Seeing that it was useless to argue with him further,
I sort of resigned myself to my fate as his
pickle partner.</p>

<p>“I have a hunch,” says I, “that it’s going to be a
whole lot worse than that. A Pickle Parlor! We’ll
be the laugh of the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“The Wright brothers were laughed at when they
tried to fly. And Edison was laughed at when he
started working on his talking machine. The easiest
thing some people can do is to ridicule any new idea
that comes up. But we should worry how much the
Tutter people laugh at us. To that point, I’d rather
have them laugh at us than ignore us. For to be
ridiculed is recognition of a sort.”</p>

<p>“Help!” I cried, holding my head. “Get the dictionary.”</p>

<p>That set Poppy to laughing. And if you could
have seen him then as I saw him you would better
understand why I like him so well. With all of his
wise talk there isn’t a boy in Tutter, where we live,
who has more real he-kid fun in him than this long-legged,
long-headed chum of mine. And that he has
big ideas is, of course, the more credit to him. As
he says, half of the fun of being a boy is getting
ready early in the game to be a man. Take the stilt
factory that I told about in the book, POPPY
OTT’S SEVEN-LEAGUE STILTS. That <i>was</i> a
big idea, let me tell you. Imagine two boys starting
a real, honest-to-goodness factory! With a
smokestack on the roof, and everything. When the
brain storm first struck my ambitious chum I declared
flat-footed that we couldn’t do it. But old
long-head said we <i>had</i> to do it, for already he had
two big stilt orders in his pocket. On the strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of these orders we borrowed money from the bank
to get started. It was pretty tough sledding for us
at first, and once we got a wallop that almost floored
us. But Poppy is like a rubber ball: the harder he
gets bowled over the higher he bounds on the come-back.
Good old Poppy!</p>

<p>To-day the stilt factory that we started is a growing
business. Mr. Ott runs it. And so spruce and
businesslike is he that at sight of him it’s hard to
believe that only a short time ago he was a shiftless,
no-account tramp. In the book, POPPY OTT
AND THE STUTTERING PARROT, I told in
detail how Poppy made his father settle down and
get a job. So you see my chum deserves credit for
that good piece of work, too. Oh, you’ve got to
hand it to Poppy, all right. He knows his cauliflower,
as the saying is. From which, no doubt,
you’ll gather that I wasn’t half as reluctant to become
his Pickle Parlor partner as I had let on. I
just talked against him for fun. All the time that I
was running his scheme down I was thinking of the
fun we were going to have and the money we were
going to earn. Money! What boy doesn’t like to
have money? And how much more it means to a
fellow when he earns the money himself. Yes, sir,
if old long-head wanted to start a Pickle Parlor or
any other kind of a parlor I was with him till the
cows came home. Of course, I had everything to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
learn. But I could watch him. And at the very
least I could dust off the pickles while he cleverly
punched the cash register. Deep down in my heart
I even confessed to myself that I was pretty lucky
to have this chance of being his business partner,
which shows how much I appreciate him. And it
makes me happy to know that he feels the same
way toward me. Two peas in a pod! That’s what
Dad calls us. But maybe, to better fit this particular
case, I should make it two cucumbers on a
cucumber vine! Huh?</p>

<p>Now that it was all settled in the leader’s active
mind that we were going to be the prosperous proprietors
of Tutter’s first and foremost Pickle Parlor,
we did the squinting act up and down Main Street
to find a suitable location for our young gold mine,
thus getting track of an empty store building. It
looked awfully big and roomy to me. I tried to picture
in my mind what it would look like when we got
it filled up with pickles. And my uneasy conclusion
was that if we <i>did</i> succeed in filling it up with
pickles we’d have enough pickles to feed the whole
United States for the next sixty-seven years. Finding
out who owned the empty building we trotted
down the street to the Canners Exchange Bank,
where we asked to see Mr. Foreman Pennykorn, the
president.</p>

<p>Of the three Tutter banks Mr. Pennykorn’s bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
is the smallest and shabbiest. It gets its name from
the canning factory that he owns. And if it wasn’t
for this factory I dare say the bank wouldn’t have
any business at all. For people as a rule don’t like
to do business with that kind of a bank any more
than they like to trade in a dingy, sleepy-looking
store. I’ve heard it said that the Pennykorn family
is one of the richest in the county. But old Mr.
Pennykorn is too tight fisted to spend any of his
money for adding machines and other up-to-date
bank stuff.</p>

<p>Waiting outside of the president’s office, at the
orders of the grumpy, suspicious-eyed cashier, we
heard voices through the unlatched door. Nor did
we feel that it was our duty to stuff up our ears.</p>

<p>“And what price have you posted for early sweet
corn?” we heard Mr. Pennykorn inquire, from
which we gathered that he was talking with his son,
Mr. Norman Pennykorn, who runs the canning factory.</p>

<p>“Nine dollars a ton.”</p>

<p>“Too much; too much,” came in a sort of petulant,
disapproving voice.</p>

<p>“But the farmers won’t sell for any less.”</p>

<p>“Um.... What’s the Ashton Canning Company
paying?”</p>

<p>“Ten-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Fools! They could buy for less.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“The farmers aren’t dumb. They know our price
is too low. And as a result a lot of them, I’ve been
told, are planning to haul their corn over to Ashton.
It’s only ten miles. And a difference of one-fifty a
ton is a big item to them.”</p>

<p>A chair creaked; after which we heard footsteps
going back and forth.</p>

<p>“I told you, Norman, when that Ashton plant was
built that we’d suffer from it. If we don’t watch our
steps they are going to seriously cut into our business.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came the grunt, “you won’t help matters
any by cutting the price on the farmers. For they’re
sore at us already.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” studied the crafty banker. “It might
be wise for us to buy up this Ashton plant. That
would give us control of the local bottom-land acreage.
The farmers then would have to sell to us at
our price. Otherwise they wouldn’t be able to sell
at all unless they shipped. And the most of them
are too dumb to attempt a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“But our canned-corn outlet doesn’t justify operating
another plant. We’d lose money.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking, Norman, that we ought to
materially increase our pickle output. Our Dandy
Dills went across fine. Very fine, indeed. The
wholesale houses expressed disappointment at the
early depletion of our stock. Considering the matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
I’ve come to the conclusion that the somewhat
extraordinary acceptance of our Dandy Dills is due,
not so much to the manufacturing processes, but to
the cucumbers, themselves. Our bottom land has
produced exceptional sweet corn. And I’m wondering
if it can’t be made to further produce exceptional
cucumbers in large quantities. That is, cucumbers
of improved texture and flavor. You probably
grasp my point. If we can greatly multiply
our pickle business, which seems entirely feasible to
me, we would be justified in taking over the Ashton
plant.”</p>

<p>“For pickles?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It is something for us to think about.”</p>

<p>“After our marked success last summer with the
new pickle line, I encouraged Mrs. O’Mally to increase
her acreage this year. And the other day I
talked with another farmer from down the river
who has a big patch. He’s feeling around for a market.
So the prospects are that we’ll quadruple our
dill output this summer.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Very fine. But don’t pay too much, Norman.
Have an eye to profits. The less we pay out
the more satisfactory our profits will be. As a
whole, this promises to be a very good year for us.
And if we can clean up fifty thousand dollars we’ll
be in excellent shape to absorb the Ashton concern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“And you really think we should cut the price on
sweet corn?”</p>

<p>“It galls me, Norman, to have to pay nine dollars
a ton. But, to take a broader view, it would be
awkward for us, I imagine, to—ah—antagonize the
farmers at this stage in our contemplated development.
So we probably had better let the nine-dollar
price stand. Or, if necessary, with the future in
mind, I even would consent to raising the price to
nine-fifty or nine-seventy-five. That will win the
farmers’ confidence. And at every opportunity you
should talk with them guardedly about cucumbers.
You might even contract for a limited acreage. By
explaining that it is experimental cannage you can
keep them from expecting too much.... By the
way, what is the boy doing this summer?”</p>

<p>“Forrest? Oh, burning up gasoline mostly.”</p>

<p>“You should put him to work in the factory. He
should be learning the business. Idleness and extravagance
are twin evils, Norman. And I cannot
countenance either, much less in the habits of my
only grandchild.”</p>

<p>Not particularly interested at first in this long-winded
business conversation, we had pricked up
our ears at the mention of pickles. For that was
stuff in our line! It was a sort of coincidence, I
told myself, that we should overhear their pickle
plans so soon after our decision to start up a Pickle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Parlor. But I never dreamed that soon the two
businesses, so to speak, would be kicking each other
in the seat of the pants.</p>

<p>A sporty-looking roadster having pulled up in
front of the bank, its owner, a boy of our age, now
sauntered lordly-like into the lobby. Forrest Pennykorn
is what I call a first-class snob. I never
did get along with him at school, and probably never
will, for the only way to keep peace with him is to
toady to him, and that is something I won’t do with
any kid, rich or poor.</p>

<p>Getting his eyes on us the snappily-dressed young
millionaire brought out a scowl. For he has about
as much love for us as we have for him.</p>

<p>“Some one must have left the back door open,”
was his clever little slap at us, as he disappeared
into his grandfather’s office. “Hi, Grandpop. Hi,
Pop. Why don’t you turn on the electric fan? It’s
hotter than an oven in here.”</p>

<p>“Not infrequently,” was the banker’s dry reply,
“it is advisable to endure slight bodily discomforts
in order to economize.”</p>

<p>“That’s all Greek to me. Say, Pop, can I have a
ten-spot? I want to take a spin over to Ashton
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Forrest, your grandfather and I have just been
talking about you. And we both feel that you’re old
enough to be of some help to me at the factory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>“The business will be yours some day. And you
ought to begin now to—”</p>

<p>A gust of wind having blown the door wide open,
it was now closed with a bang, staying latched this
time. And not knowing how much longer we might
be kept waiting, Poppy got up, sort of impatient-like,
and went over to the cashier’s window.</p>

<p>“We’re interested in Mr. Pennykorn’s empty
store building near the Lattimer meat market. Can
you tell us what it rents for?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and twenty-five a month,” snapped
the cashier, a bit peeved, I guess, that we hadn’t
taken up the business with him in the first place.</p>

<p>“One hundred and twenty-five <i>dollars</i>?” says
Poppy, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>The man nodded curtly, after which the president
and general manager of Tutter’s leading Pickle
Parlor gave a sort of wilted laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess, Mr. Blynn, that’s too steep for us.”</p>

<p>A stoop-shouldered old man had come into the
bank. And I noticed now that he was standing
where he could listen. His face looked peculiarly
familiar to me. But for the life of me I couldn’t
place him at the moment.</p>

<p>“Are you planning on starting up a store?” the
cashier thawed out under the warmth of his own
curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“A Pickle Parlor,” says Poppy, who felt, I guess,
that the sooner he started advertising the new business
the better.</p>

<p>“A <i>what</i>?” the bank clerk stared.</p>

<p>“A Pickle Parlor.”</p>

<p>“What in the name of common sense is a Pickle
Parlor?”</p>

<p>“What is an ice-cream parlor?” countered Poppy.</p>

<p>“A place where you buy ice cream.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. So a Pickle Parlor is a place where
you buy pickles.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“I rather imagine,” came modestly from the
genius of Tutter’s new enterprise, “that our Pickle
Parlor will be the first of its kind in the United
States. When completely organized it is our plan
to sell all kinds of quality pickles—apple pickles,
beet pickles and various mixtures. But at the start
we will specialize in cucumber pickles. I hope you
will give us a trial, Mr. Blynn. Pickles is pickles
for the most part, but you’ll always get preferred
pickles when you deal with us. Even your wife,
excellent cook as she no doubt is, will be unable to
make better pickles than ours. And to serve with
those tasty party sandwiches, which mean so much
to an experienced hostess, who would want to use
any pickle except the perfect pickles that are the
fame of Poppy’s Pickle Parlor? As a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
fact, we expect to get a corner on the whole pickle
business of the town. And later on we may branch
out and sprinkle a chain of Pickle Parlors all over
the state.”</p>

<p>“I swan!” the cashier stared. “I swan!”</p>

<p>A jeering laugh followed us out of the bank, for
young Pennykorn had come out of his grandfather’s
office in time to overhear Poppy’s pickle oration.</p>

<p>“Well,” I grinned at my chum, when we were in
the street, “we’re getting a lot of that ‘laughed-at’
recognition that you talked about. So you ought to
be happy.”</p>

<p>“A Pickle Parlor!” smarty hooted after us from
the door of his grandfather’s bank. “A Pickle
Parlor! Haw! haw! haw!”</p>

<p>“Jerry,” came solemnly, “do you know what I
wish?”</p>

<p>“That you could coax him into an alley and punch
his face?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I wish I could make him come into our
store and beg us to sell him some of our pickles.”</p>

<p>“Which reminds me,” says I, “that you haven’t
told me yet where you’re going to get these wonderful
pickles.”</p>

<p>“That,” says he, with a thoughtful look, “is still
a puzzle to me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night!” I squeaked, with much the same
feeling as though, having skidded off the moon, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
had landed kerflop! on the hard earth. “It’s a good
thing, I guess, that they didn’t make us a special
offer on that store. For we’d look cute trying to run
a Pickle Parlor without any pickles.”</p>

<small>OUR “SILENT” PARTNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Our</span> business career was kind of short and
snappy,” I told Poppy, when we had turned a corner
out of sight of the Canners Exchange Bank
where our enemy, Forrest Pennykorn, had just
given us the horselaugh.</p>

<p>“How do you get that ‘was’ stuff?” says he. “We
really haven’t got started yet.”</p>

<p>I had known, of course, that he would say something
like that. For when he starts out to do a
thing he usually sticks to it until he finishes it.
That’s the kind of a kid <i>he</i> is. But I pretended
that I was surprised.</p>

<p>“What?” I squeaked, as we ran into a jam of
people in front of the Parker grocery where a sale
was going on. “Haven’t you given up that scheme?”</p>

<p>There was a crash of glass on the concrete sidewalk.</p>

<p>“My pickles!” cried one of the shoppers, glaring
at poor Poppy as though she was mad enough to
snatch him bald-headed. “Stupid! Why don’t you
watch where you’re going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The offender, of course, had an apology a mile
long. Then, in his quick-minded way, he got down
on his knees and began fingering the pickled cucumbers
as they lay in a puddle of juice on the
sidewalk, acting for all the world as though he were
conducting a pickle post-mortem, or whatever you
call it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Clayton,” he finally looked up with a long
face, “you may not realize it, but this accident is
nothing short of an act of Providence. And while
it may seem to you that you have suffered a loss,
you really are going to be benefited. The very fact
that you made this purchase proves that you are a
lover of good pickles. I say <i>good</i> pickles, for, as a
pickle specialist, I can see that you bought the best
pickles that the store had. Probably they are fairly
good pickles, as pickles go. Because I am in the
pickle business myself is no reason why I should
run down anybody else’s pickles. Yet, on the other
hand, I feel that I have a right to uphold the
superior quality of my own pickles. And it is of
such pickles that I am going to make good your
loss. Not <i>store</i> pickles, Mrs. Clayton, as we usually
accept the term, but <i>home-made</i> pickles, of which
the more you eat the more you want; pickles that
you never tire of; pickles with the lasting, lingering
taste; pickles with a skin you love to touch;
pickles,” the orator soared, like a rooster flopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
over a fence, “that please but never pucker. A
wonderful treat is in store for you. And once you
have been initiated into the dinner-time joys of
perfect pickles, I hope you’ll remember me, not as
a blundering boy who bumped into you by accident,
to the loss of your bottle of store pickles, but as
the hand of Providence that led you into the light.
Poppy’s Pickle Parlor! Easy to remember, isn’t
it? If you’ll say it over two or three times you’ll
never forget it. Poppy’s Pickle Parlor! Which is
all to the point, Mrs. Clayton, that whenever you
are in need of pickles, the place to buy them, if you
want the best, is at Poppy’s Pickle Parlor, the home
of perfect pickles.”</p>

<p>Well, say! I never felt so foolish in all my life.
Poppy is all right. He is a smart kid, in fact. And
no doubt this new scheme of his was water tight.
But it struck me that he was spreading the gab too
promiscuously. Enough people would laugh at us,
I figured, without him making a monkey of himself
(and me, too!) in public.</p>

<p>“The first thing you know,” I hinted, when we
had escaped from the laughing crowd that had gathered
around us as a result of the free show, “they’ll
be locking you up in a padded cell.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” he grinned, in perfect
contentment with himself. “Don’t you like my
lingo?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“You can’t keep it up,” I told him, “and get away
with it.”</p>

<p>“It’s good advertising,” he modestly bragged on
himself.</p>

<p>“But what’s the use,” says I, “of letting on that
we have a Pickle Parlor when we haven’t?”</p>

<p>“A business is a business,” says he, “from the
time it’s organized. And we’ve been organized for
more than an hour.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any store. And you say yourself
that you don’t know where we’re going to get
our pickles.”</p>

<p>“I know where we’re going to get the first quart,”
he grinned.</p>

<p>I saw then that he was holding something back.
Which was like him, of course! And so I was prepared
for something of a surprise as I followed him
down the street to his home, where he reappeared
from the cellar with a jar of cucumber pickles,
which, on sampling, I had to acknowledge were the
swellest home-made cucumber pickles that I ever
had set my teeth into.</p>

<p>“Who made ’em?” I smacked.</p>

<p>“That,” says he, “is something I have yet to find
out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” I stared.</p>

<p>He slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“It may seem to you, Jerry, that I just jumped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
into this Pickle Parlor scheme on a moment’s notice.
But it’s a fact I’ve been twisting the scheme around
in my head for the past two days. And what put
it into my head in the first place was this jar of
pickles. Pickles like these, I told myself, would
make a storekeeper rich in no time, providing he
had enough of them to sell. And what fun it would
be, I thought, to run a store of that kind. A Pickle
Parlor! The name popped into my head just like
that,” and he snapped his fingers in illustration.
“But I ran up against a snag when I tried to find
out who had made the pickles. I have them here,
as you can see. But I don’t know where they came
from.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” says I, puzzled over his words,
“they didn’t drop out of the sky.”</p>

<p>“Last Saturday,” he explained, “the ladies of the
Presbyterian missionary society held a food sale
in Drake’s store. And there is where I bought the
jar of pickles. I didn’t ask who made them, for I
wasn’t interested ... then. And when I tried to
find out later on no one seemed to know. First, I
was sent to Mrs. Bowman on Elm Street. No, she
told me, after tasting the pickles, they weren’t out
of her kitchen. Nor could she help me. But she’d
like to buy some of the pickles, she said, if it turned
out that there were more of the same kind for sale.
I went to three women in turn. No success at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
But here’s an important point, Jerry: Every woman
who sampled the pickles wanted to buy some. So
you can see the big money that’s waiting for us if
we can find out who this unknown pickle genius is
and win her over to our scheme.”</p>

<p>There’s nothing I like better than mystery stuff.</p>

<p>“What’ll you give me,” I laughed, “if I find out
who the pickle maker is?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you president of the company.”</p>

<p>“No,” I shook my head, “that’s your job. For
it’s your idea.”</p>

<p>“Well, vice-president then.”</p>

<p>“All we’ve got to do,” I showed my stuff, “is to
get a list of the women who contributed pickles to
the church sale and then check off the names until
we come to the right one.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine if there was such a list. But
there isn’t, for I inquired. As I understand it, the
newspaper invited people in general to bring cookies
and other stuff to the sale, which explains how the
pickles happened to be brought in. Evidently some
one just walked in with them, and after setting them
down quietly walked out again.”</p>

<p>“Then,” says I, as a second lead, “we’ll advertise
in the newspaper. Or if that doesn’t do the trick,
we’ll make a house to house canvass.”</p>

<p>It was close to eleven o’clock now. And thinking
that maybe Mrs. Clayton would want her pickles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
for dinner, we filled a bottle of the same size as the
one that had been broken and hurried down the
street to the factory district, where we saw young
Pennykorn’s classy car, together with several others,
parked in a vacant lot across the street from the
canning company’s office. Just beyond was an old-fashioned
house well shut in by untrimmed trees
and ragged bushes, a familiar place to Poppy, for
he had worked here painting porches when he first
came to town. At sight of the sleepy-looking house
it suddenly popped into my head who the old man
was whom I had noticed in the bank. It was old
Mr. Weckler, the widower who had so generously
and unexpectedly put up the money for the big assembly
cabin in our Boy Scout camp. I had seen
him once or twice in camp. So in a way it was
strange that I hadn’t recognized him right off.
Still, a fellow can’t remember every face that he
sees. I’ll never forget the joy of the Scouts
when the newspaper announced Mr. Simon Weckler’s
donation. And were the Tutter people ever
surprised! For it was the general public opinion
that on top of being something of a miser the old
man hated boys, which goes to show how easily one
can be misjudged.</p>

<p>The housekeeper’s face broke into a smile when
she saw us at the back door.</p>

<p>“I hardly knew whether to believe your silly talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
or not,” she told Poppy, taking the pickles that we
had brought her.</p>

<p>“Try one,” beamed the pickle specialist, as he
caught her looking curiously into the jar, “and if
they aren’t what I represented them to be I’ll run
down town and buy you a tubful of the other
kind.”</p>

<p>“Oh ...” she cried, biting into one of the
pickles. “Aren’t they perfectly delicious! Did
your mother make them?”</p>

<p>Poppy shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he explained quietly, “my mother is dead.”</p>

<p>Here old Mr. Weckler, himself, pottered into the
kitchen, thumping along with his heavy cane, a huge
yellow cat tagging at his heels. At sight of us he
gave a dry smile, which showed clearly enough that
he hadn’t forgotten about the pickle oration that
our walking dictionary had so nobly squeezed out of
his system in front of the cashier’s window.</p>

<p>“Found a store yet?” the old man inquired.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was Poppy’s polite reply.</p>

<p>“I was in the bank when you were there and overheard
you inquiring about Pennykorn’s empty building.
Humph! If you would accept my advice
don’t rent from that man if you can possibly help
it. Too grasping; too grasping,” and the shaggy
gray head waggled sharply in conclusion.</p>

<p>“I guess,” laughed Poppy, “there’s no danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
us renting <i>any</i> building for one hundred and twenty-five
dollars a month.” Liking cats he got down on
his knees. “Hello, Peter,” he held out his hand.
“Remember me, old boy?”</p>

<p>As though it did remember him, the cat came over
and rubbed against him.</p>

<p>“Up, Peter,” commanded the old man, pleased at
the interest shown in his pet. “Show the boys what
you can do. Up, I say,” and the cat sat up as
pretty as you please.</p>

<p>“You old tyke,” says Poppy, affectionately petting
the yellow head.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t forgotten,” says Mr. Weckler, “how
you fished him out of that dry cistern and bandaged
his foot.”</p>

<p>“I see it’s all well again.”</p>

<p>“A trifle stiff in the joint, but otherwise as good
as ever.... How big a place do you figure you
need for this Pickle Parlor of yours?”</p>

<p>“I imagine we ought to start up in a small way,”
says Poppy thoughtfully. “For the chances are we
won’t have much of a stock at first. In fact,” came
the laughing admission, “after supplying you people
we have only seven pickles left. Nor do we know
yet where more of the same kind are coming
from.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clayton laughed when she heard about the
unknown pickle genius. Then, at the old man’s invitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
we followed him into the back yard, where,
almost hidden in a thicket of neglected apple trees,
we were shown a small house on the order of a
child’s playhouse, but made full height, which we
were told we could use for a store if it were big
enough for us.</p>

<p>“Originally a summerhouse, I built it over to
please my daughter,” the old man told us quietly.
And there was something in the tone of his voice
that made us think that the memory of his daughter
wasn’t a happy one. “It’s of no use to me now.
As a matter of fact, this is the first time that I have
been inside of it for years. For your purpose, of
course, it would be better to move it to my vacant
lot across the street from the canning factory.”</p>

<p>Poppy fairly danced with joy.</p>

<p>“Why, there couldn’t <i>anything</i> be better, Mr.
Weckler. It fits our scheme to a ‘T.’ For like the
scheme, itself, it’s different. Everybody will notice
it. And it’s plenty big enough, too. We can build
our shelves on the sides,” he began to plan, “and put
the counter back here. Of course,” he ran off into
a merry laugh, “it won’t be a very <i>big</i> counter.”
Then he stopped. “But maybe,” he looked up at
the old man with his big solemn eyes, “we can’t
afford to pay you what it’s worth.”</p>

<p>“You paid for it,” came shortly, “when you went
down into the cistern to rescue my cat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“But that wasn’t anything. I’d do that for <i>any</i>
cat.”</p>

<p>I could see that the old man liked Poppy. For
his eyes showed it.</p>

<p>“I dare say you would,” he nodded. “Which is
all the more reason why you’re deserving of any help
that I can give you. No, you needn’t say any more
about it. The playhouse is yours to take or leave, as
you see fit. As for moving it onto my lot, if you decide
to do that you can pay me five dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Only five dollars a month for the whole business?”
cried Poppy. “That isn’t enough. We expect
to make a lot of money when we get organized.
And I don’t think it’s right for us to fill our own
pockets and not pay you what we should.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” came the dry suggestion, “you would
like to take me into partnership with you.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” cried Poppy.</p>

<p>“Very well,” the old man gravely accepted the
honor. “You may call me your ‘silent’ partner, if
you wish. Which means that you’re to run the
business as you see fit and I’m to look on. As for
sharing in the profits, I’ll take my pay in pickles.”</p>

<p>“So many pickles as <i>that</i>?” Poppy looked his
surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh,” came dryly, “it may not be so terribly
many. Probably not more than two or three quarts
a month at the most.”</p>

<small>WHOSE PICKLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What’s</span> luckier than the left-hand foot of a
tongue-tied graveyard rabbit?” says I to Poppy,
when our “silent” partner had gone into the house
to eat his dinner.</p>

<p>I thought at first that old long-face wasn’t going
to answer me, so busy was he building shelves and
counters in his mind. But finally it percolated into
his crowded cranium that I had asked him a question.</p>

<p>“What?” says he, deciding that shelf number six
was a trifle too high and that the wrapping counter
needed to be shoved a thirty-second of an inch to
the left.</p>

<p>“A cat in a cistern,” says I.</p>

<p>“Cuckoo!” was his lack of appreciation of my
cleverness.</p>

<p>“I’m not talking about ‘cuckoos,’” I threw back
at him. “I’m talking about cats—k-a-t-z, cats.
And the point is, that if Mr. Weckler’s tomcat
hadn’t skidded into a convenient cistern, thus giving
you a chance to do the hero stuff, our Pickle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Parlor might have cut its baby teeth in a dry-goods
box instead of a juvenile bungalow. Hence the
good luck to us, as I say. Oh, you needn’t look so
disgusted,” I began to spar at him, “or the first
thing you know I’ll show you how easy a vice-president
can take a mere president down and rub dirt
on the end of his nose.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” he laughed, “I’m busy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take it so seriously, Poppy,” I further
kept at him. “For this isn’t a morgue—it’s a Pickle
Parlor.”</p>

<p>“To listen to you,” was the nice little hunk of
flattery that he shoved at me, “anyone would think
it was a lunatic asylum.”</p>

<p>I picked off some of his high-falutin’ oratory.</p>

<p>“Poppy’s petrified pickles,” I swept the air with
my arms. “The perfect pickles with a puckery
past; the quicker you eat them the shorter you
last.” Then I let out a yip. “Look me over, kid,”
I strutted around. “I’m a real poet.”</p>

<p>“Yah, a poet ... but you don’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Say, Poppy?”</p>

<p>“Well, what now?”</p>

<p>“Have you got your private office picked out
yet?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” he grinned. “It’s on the ninth
floor.”</p>

<p>“Toot! Toot!” says I, pretending that I was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
elevator. “Anybody going up to the president’s
office?” Then I took a lath that lay on the floor
and smacked old doo-funny a sharp crack on the
seat of the pants. “Look out!” I staggered, pretending
this time that my arms were loaded full.
“I just dropped a jar of pickled carpet tacks.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I fool around that way a lot. It’s kid
stuff, I know. And kind of silly. But in a way it
bears out that old saying of Dad’s: Every day a
little fun and a little business.</p>

<p>Having completed the entertainment, so to speak,
I got down to business, making the suggestion that
we paint the outside of our store yellow with green
trimmings. The “yellow” would be the cucumber
blossoms, I brilliantly explained, and the “green”
would be the pickles. The inside was to be painted,
too, but, of course, we couldn’t do that until the
shelves and counter had been made. Spick and
span and nothing else but—that was our idea of
what a store should be. And it was the right idea,
too.</p>

<p>“How about a sign?” says I, as the self-appointed
decorator. “Do you want me to paint that,
too?”</p>

<p>“What are we going to put on it?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“‘Poppy’s Pickle Parlor,’ of course,” says I,
looking at him in surprise. “I thought that was all
settled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“But it’s <i>your</i> Pickle Parlor,” says he, “just as
much as it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” says I, getting the point of his
unselfishness. “But ‘Poppy’s Pickle Parlor’ is a
better name than ‘Jerry’s Pickle Parlor.’ For
the ‘P’ in Poppy sort of rhymes with the ‘P’ in
pickles.”</p>

<p>“Alliteration,” old brain-bag swung in.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” I cheerfully
showed my ignorance.</p>

<p>“Using the three words, all beginning with ‘P,’ is
what is called alliteration. You see a lot of it in
advertising. In fact,” he admitted, “that’s where
I got my idea.”</p>

<p>Getting the measurements of our new store, which
proved to be six feet wide by eight feet long, we
made a diagram, or, as Poppy called it, a floor plan,
a copy of which is printed on the opposite page.
You may wonder where we expected to pick off a
cash register. As a matter of fact, we didn’t expect
to own a cash register for a long time. But a floor
plan, to use the leader’s words, was intended to
show everything <i>complete</i>. And that is why we put
the cash register in ahead of time, along with the
two prospective pickle barrels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Before we go any farther,” says Poppy, “I think
we better check up and see how we stand on the
money question. For it will take a good bit of jack
to pay for the paint and shelf lumber. Then, too,
we’ll have to hire a house mover.”</p>

<p>“It won’t cost much,” I grinned, “to move this
house.”</p>

<p>“Probably not. But we won’t get the job done
for nothing. How about putting in fifty dollars
apiece?”</p>

<p>That was all right with me, I agreed. Then, as
the lodge saying is, we adjourned, stretching our
legs in the direction of home, having been reminded
by the one o’clock factory whistles that we hadn’t
had dinner yet. Later we met in Mr. Thomas Lorring’s
bank where we opened a hundred-dollar
checking account in the name of Poppy’s Pickle
Parlor, after which we ordered our lumber and
paint, not forgetting to put an ad in the <i>Tutter
Daily Globe</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Lorring, you will remember, was the banker
who helped us start up our stilt factory, out of
which we made several hundred dollars. He sure
used us fine. And that is why we went back to
him.</p>

<p>Poppy is a regular little gee whizz when it comes
to sawing and fitting. Boy, you should have seen
the way those shelves danced into place! I ran a
race with him, slinging yellow and green paint
right and left, but he beat me by a mile. Still, if I
could have added to the paint that I put on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
store what I got on the old overalls that Mr. Weckler
had so wisely provided, I guess the race would
have been a tie.</p>

<p>Throughout our afternoon’s work the old man
pottered here and there, silently taking in everything
with a critical, interested eye. Mrs. Clayton,
too, came out to see how we were getting along,
bringing a big pitcher of lemonade. Um-yum! The
best lemonade I ever tasted. Having lapped up
two or three quarts, more or less, my painting
speed increased thirty-eight strokes to the minute.</p>

<p>People living in small towns usually keep pretty
close tab on their neighbors. So, after Poppy’s two
wild “pickle” spiels, first in the bank and again in
front of the Parker grocery, it soon got noised about
that a new local business was about to blossom
forth. A Pickle Parlor! Kids who heard what we
were doing came and rubbered at us over the fence
that inclosed Mr. Weckler’s neglected garden. And
older friends of ours smiled at us when they met
us in the street. The general opinion was, as I had
told Poppy in the beginning, that such a store would
fizzle out for want of business. Of course, there was
a “secret” side to our plans that our friends didn’t
know about. And, to that point, I was to learn
later on that my brainy partner had still other dope
in his head that he hadn’t dished out to me. Not
for one instant had it occurred to me that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
bigger and better equipped than an ordinary
kitchen would be needed to cook the big wad of
pickles that we hoped to sell. But, as I say, old
Poppy already had dreams of a pickle factory in the
back part of his mind. That kid! First it was
stilts and now it was pickles. I never saw the beat
of him. And what is more I never expect to.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we knocked off for the day, telling
Mr. Weckler that we would be back the first thing
in the morning. Mother nearly had a cat fit when
she saw me. And no wonder! For so “stuck up”
was I from my painting job that it took me an hour
to get the green and yellow paint out of my hair.
But what was that to upset a young business man!</p>

<p>At the first chance I got the evening newspaper
away from Dad and skimmed up and down the
columns to find our ad. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="large">WHOSE PICKLES</span></p>

<p>Something of great value was found in a
quart jar of cucumber pickles purchased
last Saturday at the Presbyterian missionary
food sale in Drake’s store.</p>

<p>Seven diamonds worth ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Were they <i>your</i> pickles? It will pay you to
find out. Address, Box 9, <i>Tutter Daily
Globe</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>I read the ad a second time, hardly able to believe
my eyes. Seven diamonds worth ten thousand dollars!
What in Sam Hill was Poppy’s object in telling
a lie like that? I had helped him write the ad;
and it was my understanding that the “something
of great value” that had been found in the pickles
was the idea that my chum had of selling the
pickles in great quantities, which, of course, would
bring riches to the pickle maker. But there had
been no mention of “diamonds” to me.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” my chum called up on the ’phone,
“did you see our ad in to-night’s paper?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I shot back at him, “and if you want to
know the plain truth of the matter I don’t think
much of it, either. For it isn’t on the square.”</p>

<p>“They pulled a boner in the newspaper office,” he
then explained. “That line about the diamonds was
lifted out of another article and put into our ad by
mistake. The editor just told me so over the
’phone. I’m wondering now what the result of the
mistake will be.”</p>

<p>We weren’t long in finding out. In the next two
days we received sixty-three letters. Nor was it
an easy matter for us to find out which one of these
sixty-three pickle makers was the pickle genius of
whom we were in search.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A BUSY DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> mistake that our proof reader made in your
ad,” the newspaper editor admitted to us the following
morning, “was nothing short of downright carelessness.
Still,” he laughed, handing us six letters,
“it doesn’t seem to have done you any harm.”</p>

<p>It was explained to us then just how the mistake
had occurred. Right beside our ad in the newspaper
“form” was an article telling about a jewelry-store
robbery. A line in this article had to be reset
on the linotype machine. And in making the correction
the proof reader got the new “slug,” as the
line of type was called, into the middle of our ad
instead of in the robbery article, where it belonged.</p>

<p>Having been told by the editor that he would
print the corrected ad free of charge, we thanked
him and hurried out of the newspaper office, stopping
at the first corner to see who our six letters
were from.</p>

<p>“I saw your advertisement in to-night’s <i>Globe</i>,”
wrote a woman on Oak Street. “I can easily identify
my jar of pickles. My husband, who doubts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the truth of the advertisement, says, anyhow, that
it couldn’t have been our pickles in which the diamonds
were found, for we never owned a diamond
in all our lives except my engagement ring. Nevertheless,
I would like to know for sure that mine
isn’t the lucky jar.”</p>

<p>The next letter was from a woman by the name
of Mrs. Hiram Springer.</p>

<p>“My attention was called this evening to your
current advertising in our local newspaper. I certainly
can’t say that the diamonds are mine, granting
that your story of finding them is true, for I
never owned but one small diamond. Were the
diamonds <i>in</i> the cucumbers, or just in the bottom
of the jar? I’m wondering if I actually pickled
jeweled cucumbers! Yet how <i>could</i> the diamonds
have gotten into the cucumbers? But tell me,
please, what you know. And I’m hoping, of course,
that it was in my jar that the diamonds were
found.”</p>

<p>While it turned out that a lot of the women who
wrote to us never had contributed pickles to the
food sale, it isn’t to be thought of them that they
tried to cheat. Take the case of Mrs. Cook on
South Main Street. She hadn’t given the church
people any pickles. But she <i>had</i> sent pickles to a
number of her church-going neighbors. And so at
sight of our ad her first thought was that possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the diamonds, which could have been in the green
cucumbers, though not without mystery, had turned
up in one of these scattered jars. Naturally, if such
was the case she intended to press her claim.
Another woman having had some pickles sent to her
by an eccentric country relative jumped to the
excited conclusion that “rich Aunt Hattie,” as the
relative was called, had put the diamonds into the
pickle jar as a pleasing surprise. Some canned fruit
had been stolen from her cellar, and how logical,
was her quick conclusion, that a jar of “Aunt Hattie’s
pickles” had thus peculiarly found its way
into the hands of the church people! You can see
from this why so many letters had been written to
us. No one who had any possible chance of laying
claim to the diamonds stood idly by. For nothing
was to be lost by writing; and there was a chance
of great gain.</p>

<p>As we had to have pickles before we could open
up our business, it was of more importance, Poppy
said, to find out who the lucky pickle maker was
than to finish painting our store, so, after a hurried
trip to Mr. Weckler’s house, to see if the paint was
drying, we headed for 616 Elm Street to interview
the first one of the six women who had written
to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan was very eager to let us into her
house when she found out that we had her letter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
But she got rid of us in a hurry when she learned
the truth about the “diamonds.” I couldn’t see,
though, what right she had to get out of patience
with us and accuse us of trickery. But that just
goes to show how unreasonable some people can be.</p>

<p>Our next stop was at Mrs. Hempline’s house,
where we were given much better treatment. Yes,
was the cheerful, even eager admission, she had
contributed pickles to the food sale. But we found
on sampling her pickles that we were in the wrong
house.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” says I, when we hit the street. “Did you
see the look on her face when we backed out of
the house? I bet anything she thinks we’re cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“How could she think different,” grinned Poppy,
“with you along?”</p>

<p>The balance of our calls were no more successful
than the first two. Of the six women, three had
contributed pickles to the food sale. But the pickles
that we sampled weren’t the pickles that we were
looking for. In fact, at one house the pickles were
no good at all. They tasted to me as though they
had been put up in dish water.</p>

<p>“Hey!” a kid called to us across the street. “Mr.
Stair wants to see you.”</p>

<p>Hurrying to the newspaper office, we were given
fourteen more letters and a telegram.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” grinned the editor, “there’s a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
people hereabouts who want to wear diamonds.”
Then he looked at us curiously. “By the way,” he
inquired, “what was it that you found in the
pickles?”</p>

<p>“An idea,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“But you said it was something of great value.”</p>

<p>“The right kind of an idea,” says Poppy, “is frequently
worth a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“If it’s news ...” came the hint.</p>

<p>“I hope it will be big news some day,” says
Poppy, thinking of a new factory. “But I can’t tell
you about it now.”</p>

<p>The editor continued to regard us curiously.</p>

<p>“I understand that you boys are going to start
up a pickle store.”</p>

<p>“A Pickle Parlor,” came the polite correction.</p>

<p>The newspaper man laughed.</p>

<p>“Pickles? A Pickle Parlor? Evidently,” he used
his head, “this ‘big idea’ of yours has something to
do with pickles.”</p>

<p>“If you were to guess for the next thousand
years,” grinned Poppy, “you couldn’t guess any
closer than that.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the boy,” the man’s eyes then
showed their admiration, “who brought the stilt
idea to town?”</p>

<p>“We’re the <i>boys</i>,” corrected Poppy, which shows
what kind of a pal <i>he</i> is. Yes, sir, as I’ve said before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
when the angels were putting old Poppy together
they dumped in an extra gob of fairness.
And then to sort of balance things they put in
another extra gob of squareness, with the result that
he’s the <i>fairest</i> and <i>squarest</i> pal I ever had or ever
hope to have if I live a million years.</p>

<p>“Wire collect complete detailed description of
diamonds,” our telegram read. And when we saw
that it was signed by the Peoria chief of police you
could have sliced off our eyes with a baseball bat.</p>

<p>“Wow!” says Poppy. “This is getting kind of
complicated.”</p>

<p>I have no better grown-up friend in all Tutter
than Bill Hadley, the town marshal. So we went
to him to find out what we should do about the
telegram. Billy had a good laugh when he heard
of our predicament. We weren’t to worry about the
telegram, he said. He’d take care of that matter
for us.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” was his opinion, “there’s been a diamond
robbery down in Peoria, an’ that’s why the
chief wants a description of your diamonds.”</p>

<p>“What if we get more such telegrams from
Chicago and other cities?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Just bring ’em to me.”</p>

<p>We put in the whole morning and the biggest part
of the afternoon following up the letters that were
mailed to us through the newspaper office. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
second batch of letters brought us no more success
than the first six. At noon we were handed more.
Twenty-six this trip. Can you imagine! We called
on short women, tall women, young women, old
women, pretty women, cross-looking women, skinny
women, fat women, women who had lost their husbands,
and a few who still were wishing. For by
three o’clock a total of fifty-four letters had been
received at the newspaper office. We sampled so
many pickles that they began to stick out of our
eyes. Toward the last the sight of a pickle made
me gag. And this, by the way, got us into trouble.
For one woman caught me turning up my nose at
her pickles and landed on me with a broom.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you to ask me for pickles and then
turn up your nose at them behind my back,” she
screeched. “Take that, you young whippersnapper.
And <i>that</i> and <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>Poor me! The wonder is that I escaped without
a broken neck. For that old girl sure could swat.
As for Poppy, he never cracked a smile.</p>

<p>“Oof!” he gagged, when we were in the street.
“I’m not surprised that you turned up your nose.
For my part I almost turned up my toes. The
worst pickles that I ever tasted in all my life.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to wonder,” says I wearily, when
the street quit spinning around and around, “if we’ll
ever be able to find this wonderful pickle maker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“We’ve got to,” says he. “For if we don’t our
Pickle Parlor will be a fizzle. As I told you yesterday,
the people will come to our store to buy better
pickles. But we can’t hope to attract them with
ordinary pickles.”</p>

<p>“Some of the pickles I’ve tasted to-day would
kill a nanny goat with a cast-iron stomach.”</p>

<p>“Which should make us realize all the more,”
says Poppy, “how popular our Pickle Parlor will be
when we get properly organized.”</p>

<p>I thought of something.</p>

<p>“Did you ever read the book about Dr. Jekyl
and Mr. Hyde?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that?” he looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, Dr. Jekyl got hold of a drug that changed
him into Mr. Hyde, and then Mr. Hyde used another
drug that changed him back into Dr. Jekyl.
Everything was going along fine and dandy until
the drug supply ran out. Dr. Jekyl couldn’t find
any more drugs with the right kind of stuff in them,
which proved to him that the original drugs were a
sort of accident. It may be the same with this one
jar of pickles.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t impossible,” says Poppy, “but I’m
not going to let myself believe it.”</p>

<p>By the time I got home there were things going
on in my stomach that weren’t right. Nor did it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
help matters any when I tried to hold down the
celebrating pickles with mashed potatoes and gravy.</p>

<p>Mother beamed at me across the supper table.</p>

<p>“Have some pickles,” says she generously.</p>

<p>“No!” I cried, with a shudder. Pickles! The
last thing I wanted was more pickles.</p>

<p>“Why, Jerry! What’s the matter with you? You
look white.”</p>

<p>Dad glanced up from his newspaper.</p>

<p>“Too much candy, I bet a cookie. You shouldn’t
eat so much sweet stuff, Son,” he lectured. “You’re
getting too big for that.” Then, what do you know
if he didn’t shove a second dish of pickles at me!
“Here, try something sour for a change. It’ll do
your stomach good.”</p>

<p>Pickles! Suddenly I was caught in a whirl of
pickles. Mixed pickles! Pear pickles! Apple
pickles! Cucumber pickles! String-bean pickles!
Peach pickles! Tomato pickles! They came at me
with blood in their eyes. I tried to run. But I
couldn’t get away from them. Biff! The cucumber
pickles soaked me a sledge-hammer blow on the end
of the snout, while at the same time the string-bean
pickles lifted up the tail of my coat and performed
with perfect aim. Again I tried to run, but they
got in front of me and cut me off. When I fell they
landed on top of me. I saw I was a goner. And
then—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Sort of coming back to earth, as it were, I found
Mother steadying me.</p>

<p>“I’ll help what’s left of him to bed,” I heard her
tell Dad, “while you get the scoop shovel and
clean up.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I almost</span> died. But when I got all ready to do
it, sort of, with Dad flying around like a rooster
with its head cut off and Mother rubbing my stomach
with a hot cloth that looked to me like an old
woolen petticoat, Doc Leland bustled into the house
with his pill case, out of which he mixed up some
dope that did the miracle, as the saying is. And
how wonderful it was to know, in the relief that
Doc’s pills and a hot-water bottle brought to me,
that I was going to have the chance, after all, of
helping Poppy run the Pickle Parlor.</p>

<p>“Let this be a lesson to you,” lectured Doc,
oggling me through his big nose glasses, “an’ don’t
make a pig of yourself the next time you happen to
sneak up on an unchaperoned pickle dish.”</p>

<p>“Pickles!” I gagged ... and you should have
seen Dad jump for the basin! “I never want to eat
another pickle as long as I live.”</p>

<p>Poppy, the big monkey, came in the next morning
with a hunk of cauliflower tied up in fancy ribbons
like a sick-room bouquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“When you get through with it,” he grinned,
“your ma can pickle it.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” I shuddered. “Talk of anything else but
pickles.”</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” he earnestly leaned over the bed,
“I’ve got some news for you. We had a burglar in
our house last night.”</p>

<p>“What?” I cried, staring at him.</p>

<p>“I thought during the night that I heard a noise
in the cellar. But laying it to the cat, I didn’t get
up, though now I wish I had.”</p>

<p>“But what would a burglar be doing in your cellar?”
I further stared at him.</p>

<p>“That’s the queer part. Nothing was taken. But
every jar of pickles that we owned was opened and
the pickles dumped into a pile in the middle of the
floor.”</p>

<p>Again I raised the “Stop!” signal on him.</p>

<p>“Make it ketchup,” I grimaced.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it,” he laughed, “it was ketchup.
But I’d like to have you tell me,” he went on,
serious again, “why a burglar should break into our
cellar and destroy our canned pick—I mean our
ketchup.”</p>

<p>As I have written down in other books, mentioned
in the preface of this book, I have had a
good bit of experience solving unusual mysteries.
At one time I really called myself a Juvenile Jupiter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Detective. That was in my “Whispering Mummy”
book. So I’m right at home on the “mystery”
dope.</p>

<p>“The burglar was looking for something,” says I,
showing my stuff. “And if you’re half as smart as
I think you are you ought to guess what that something
is.”</p>

<p>“Diamonds?” says he.</p>

<p>“Nothing else but.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that. But it was such a crazy
theory that I quickly dropped it. In the first place
there are no diamonds. And if there had been,
certainly, after finding them, I wouldn’t have been
dumb enough to put them back in the pickle jar.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says I, so interested now that I didn’t
care a rap whether he said “pickles” or not, “the
burglar thinks you have diamonds in all of your
jars.”</p>

<p>“Then he must be cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” was the view I then took, trying
to find a deeper object for the queer act, “that
there’s mystery going on that we don’t know
about?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There was a diamond robbery in Peoria. Bill
Hadley said so. And maybe one of the thieves told
his accomplice that he’d hide the booty in Tutter
in somebody’s cellar. The fellow you heard could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
have been the accomplice trying to find his share
of the hidden diamonds.”</p>

<p>I didn’t mean it, of course. It was pure nonsense.
But you should have seen Poppy’s face!</p>

<p>“I think,” says he, “that you’d better have Doc
Leland come back and doctor your head as well as
your stomach.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” I laughed, “it was the diamonds
that brought the burglar to your home. It couldn’t
have been anything else. Reading our ad, he found
out somehow that you were back of it, and naturally
his idea was that you had the diamonds in the
house. So he tried to find them. It was queer, of
course, that he searched for them only in the cellar.
But that’s nothing. The main point is, will he come
back again, hoping for better luck, or won’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Everybody in town ought to know by this time
that there are no real diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Evidently your burglar didn’t know the truth
last night.... Did you tell Bill Hadley?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Bill is pretty smart at keeping an eye on strangers.
And he’ll know if there’s any suspicious characters
hanging around town.”</p>

<p>I was then told by my chum that he had gotten
nine more letters at the newspaper office. We went
through these together. And later Poppy did the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
usual calling and pickle-sampling act. But to no
success.</p>

<p>I hardly knew what to think. It didn’t seem possible
to me that any woman in Tutter could have
missed seeing our ad. Then, too, there had been a
lot of talk among the women about the “lucky pickle
jar,” which all helped to make the news general.
Yet, in all of our calls we hadn’t found the slightest
trace of the particular pickles of which we were in
need.</p>

<p>Could it be, as I had told Poppy that the one jar
of pickles that had cranked up his imagination to
such rosy Pickle Parlor dreams had been an accident,
like the original Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde
drug? And had we unknowingly talked with the
woman who had made the pickles? If such was
the case, certainly we ought to step on the gas and
find her. For having once done the job right, even
though by accident, she probably could learn to
repeat. A little experimenting would do the trick.</p>

<p>I didn’t see any more of Poppy until evening. He
had put in the afternoon slinging paint, he told me.
Having finished the store-painting job, both inside
and out, everything was now as slick as a button,
and all we had to do was to wait for the paint to
dry, which wouldn’t take more than two or three
days.</p>

<p>“I even painted the sign,” he laughed. “Gee, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
ought to see it. It looks like a million dollars.”</p>

<p>“But, Poppy,” says I, sort of perplexed, “what
are we going to do with the store if we fall down on
finding this star pickle maker? Had you thought of
that?”</p>

<p>“Before I give up,” says he, “I’ll borrow every
pickle recipe within ten miles and try them out
myself.”</p>

<p>Which was a perfectly sound scheme, of course
... granting that we had oceans of time. But here
we were within a week or ten days of heavy cucumber
harvest.</p>

<p>No, we never could hope to get the necessary
pickle supply started, for early business, by going
about it in that way. And in twisting the matter
around in my mind I began to wonder if we couldn’t
sort of save our proposed business by changing it
into a Popcorn Parlor. We could sell peanuts, too;
even put in a stock of chewing gum and candy. Of
course, a store like that hadn’t the originality, as
you call it, of a Pickle Parlor, and hence wasn’t as
exciting to think about. But it would be a store—<i>our</i>
store, in fact. And as long as the business was
ours what difference did it make to us what we sold?
Certainly, was my further thought, it would be no
trick to change the sign from “Poppy’s Pickle Parlor”
to “Poppy’s Popcorn Parlor.”</p>

<p>Doc Leland had dished out the order that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to stay in bed. But I got up and dressed the following
morning, feeling quite like myself again except
that the thought of pickles still gagged me. The
letters now had stopped coming in. So we hadn’t
any of the follow-up work to do. Nor was there
anything we could do at Mr. Weckler’s house except
to walk around our green and yellow store and admire
it. Boy, we sure were the proud little peacocks.
<i>Our</i> store! Of course, we didn’t own it;
and, to that point, Mr. Weckler hadn’t told us just
how long we could use it. But he was our “silent”
partner. And having a warm interest in us, as we
could see, our opinion was that he would let us use
the store as long as we needed it.</p>

<p>That morning we took a trip into Zulutown, which
is the name that the Tutter people have for the
tough end of town beyond Dad’s brickyard, to talk
with Mr. Butch McGinty about moving our store.
I suppose Mr. McGinty has some other front name
besides “Butch.” But that’s the only name I ever
heard him called by. And it sure fits him to a “T”—big
ox that he is, so hairy and red-nosed. An old
bachelor, his home in Zulutown is the dirtiest place
I ever set eyes on. He does his own cooking and
housekeeping. It isn’t anything surprising to go
into his house and find the cat sleeping in the middle
of the dinner table. I’d hate to live that way.</p>

<p>Mr. McGinty’s business is “towing,” for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
purpose he keeps a mule. He also moves small
houses and hauls ashes. If you live near a canal
you know what I mean by “towing.” It is much
the same as house moving, only the thing that is
“towed” isn’t a house, but a barge or flatboat. With
all of his “towing” and house-moving work old
Butch hasn’t much to do, for in a small town like
Tutter the houses usually are left where they’re
built. But when a job of this kind bobs up he
usually gets it.</p>

<p>We found him in the kitchen baking cookies.</p>

<p>“Howdy, boys,” he welcomed us, acting so
friendly about it that I could almost imagine that
he knew we had a job for him. “Jest dump that
stuff off them chairs,” he pointed, “an’ make yourselves
homely.” Then he gave a leap for the oven,
which was smoking out of its cracks like a volcano
with a dozen craters. In his hurry to throw open
the oven door he forgot to grab a cloth holder ...
and thus burning his fingers maybe you think he
didn’t explode! “Drat the luck! That’s the second
batch of cookies that I’ve burnt to a crisp. Jest
look at ’em!” and he dumped the junk into the
middle of the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>You can’t be around Mr. McGinty without grinning.
For he’s funny. And we grinned all the
harder when he scratched his head with the cookie
cutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“This thing of bein’ a bachelor,” he complained,
disgusted with his poor work, “hain’t what it’s
cracked up to be. Fur it never was intended nohow
that a man should be his own cook. <i>Me?</i>—outside
of makin’ pickles an’ pancakes I kain’t cook fur two
cents. As fur sweepin’ an’ dustin’, they’s a way
of doin’ it proper, I s’pose, but I’ve never yet
found it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get married?” laughed Poppy.</p>

<p>That brought a snort.</p>

<p>“An ol’ fool like me?” he ran himself down,
though with twinkling eyes. “They hain’t nobody
as would have me.”</p>

<p>I wanted to ask him how about the Widow
O’Mally who lives in the old Weir house in the river
bottoms. For everybody in Tutter knows that he
shines around her every chance he gets. Dirty as
he is in his own home, he’s some foxy old sheik, let
me tell you, when he gets dolled up in his sparking
clothes. But, of course, he wasn’t going to admit
any of that stuff to a couple of boys.</p>

<p>He had better luck with the next batch of cookies.</p>

<p>“Jest help yourselves, boys,” was the liberal invitation,
as he scooped the cookies out of the black
pan with a pancake turner that was used other times
for swatting flies. “I know how boys is,” he added,
wiping off a cookie that had rolled across the floor.
“You kain’t git ’em filled up. I was that way, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
when I was your age. So don’t be bashful. Jest
pitch in an’ help yourselves. When I’ve got company
I like to see ’em eat.”</p>

<p>We did the mannerly thing, of course, each of
us taking a cookie and thanking him for it. Nibbling
at mine, sort of gingerly, I found it wasn’t
half bad.</p>

<p>Well, we came to terms about the house moving.
It would cost us ten bucks, Butch said. Poppy tried
to bring him down to nine dollars, figuring, I guess,
that every dollar saved was a dollar earned, but, no,
the house mover held out, ten dollars was his price,
and we could take it or leave it.</p>

<p>Here I ran to the barn to say hello to Jerusalem,
the “tow” mule, for we’re old friends. I wasn’t
there very long. And when I joined Poppy in the
street I noticed that he was acting sort of peculiar-like.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” says he, “are you prepared for a
big surprise?”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong now?” says I.</p>

<p>He fished something out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“Oof!” I turned up my nose. “Another pickle.”</p>

<p>“Mr. McGinty treated me to pickles while you
were outside. And as they didn’t look so worse I
bit into one. Before that, as you may remember,
he had said something about making pickles. But it
never had percolated into my bean that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>I saw what was coming.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” I squeaked, staring at him in sudden
dizziness. “Is <i>he</i> the pickle genius that we’ve been
searching for?”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt of it. I ate seven of his
pickles. Wonderful! He had given six quarts to
the church people, he told me, as they always hired
him to haul their ashes.” From the look on the
other’s face I could imagine that he had in his mind
a picture of a kitchen cluttered with cobwebs, with
dirty walls and a dirtier stove. “I’m beginning to
wonder,” says he, looking dazed, “where we’re going
to come out.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>POPPY’S “AUNT JEMIMA” SCHEME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> our search for the pickle genius we hadn’t
dreamed for the tail end of a second that anyone
short of a first-class cook had made the poochy
pickles. And we had sort of pictured in our minds
a spotless kitchen, puddled with sunshine, with a
line-up of shiny aluminum kettles on the shelves,
clever little ruffled doo-dads at the windows, a gurgling
canary, and, to finish off, an old rag rug of
many colors in the middle of the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>With all this junk in our minds, consider, then,
the shock to us of learning that the pickle genius
was no other than old Butch McGinty. The Tutter
mule driver! Wow! As the saying is, we were
completely flabbergasted.</p>

<p>For we realized, of course, that the one thing we
couldn’t do would be to popularize old Butch’s
pickles in Tutter. Without a doubt they were the
most wonderful pickles that ever swam around in a
canning jar. But, even so, who among the Tutter
people would want to eat them? Certainly, no one
who knew the mule driver, himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Our pickle ship having gone on the rocks, as it
were, I hastened to comfort Poppy with the suggestion
that our store could easily be changed over
into a Popcorn Parlor. So we really weren’t out
anything except some shoe leather and the cost of
our newspaper ad.</p>

<p>But instead of falling on my neck in grateful
appreciation he hoisted up the coat tails of my
scheme and gave it a swift kick.</p>

<p>“I graduated from popcorn two years ago,” says
he, thus reminding me that it was from selling popcorn
that he had gotten his nickname.</p>

<p>But I dug in.</p>

<p>“Popcorn, peanuts and chewing gum,” I recited.</p>

<p>“Pickles,” says he, “and nothing else but.”</p>

<p>“Poppy,” I then lit into him, “you’re a bull-head.”</p>

<p>“Just so you don’t call me a crab,” he laughed.</p>

<p>You can’t very well scrap with a chum who sort
of pokes fun at himself instead of handing it back,
so I shut up. Dog-gone <i>him</i>! If he thought for
one instant that he could sell old Butch’s pickles in
Tutter let him go ahead and try it. He’d wish in
the end that he had listened to me.</p>

<p>“Of course,” says he, sort of reading my thoughts,
“I realize that pickles made in Mr. McGinty’s house
won’t sell. But we can have them made some place
else. All we’ve got to do is to borrow his pickle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
recipe. And then your mother, or any other woman,
can do the trick.”</p>

<p>“Some one tap me on the dome with a pile driver,”
says I. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s decided,” grinned old heavy-brain,
“that we’re going to stick to pickles and forget about
the peanuts and chewing gum?”</p>

<p>“Pickles it is, kid.”</p>

<p>But we struck a snag when we tried to separate
old Butch from his choice recipe. Nothin’ doin’, he
said. The recipe was a secret. And much less
than give us a copy of it, he wouldn’t sell us a copy
for a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“How would it be,” Poppy then suggested, “if
we used your recipe and paid you a royalty?”</p>

<p>Butch knew a lot of things, but it was mostly
about mules.</p>

<p>“A which?” says he.</p>

<p>“A royalty.”</p>

<p>“What’s a royalty?”</p>

<p>“We use your recipe. See? And having made a
lot of pickles we sell them. All right. Every time
we take in ten dollars we put nine dollars into <i>our</i>
money box and one dollar into <i>your</i> money box.
The money is your royalty—or, in other words,
your pay—for letting us use your recipe.”</p>

<p>“Kain’t do it,” he again turned us down.</p>

<p>“Why not? Isn’t ten per cent enough for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“A promise is a promise.”</p>

<p>“Meaning which?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“As I told you, the recipe is a secret. An’ when
it was given to me I was made to promise that I’d
never let it git out of my hands.”</p>

<p>I quickly got the leader’s ear.</p>

<p>“Find out who gave him the recipe,” I whispered.</p>

<p>But did we put anything over on old Butch? Not
so you could notice it. Instead of dishing out to
us the hoped-for answer, he started talking about
the time his mule rolled in a box of mortar and lost
all its hair.</p>

<p>There was a “do-or-die” look on Poppy’s face.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have pickles,” says he.</p>

<p>“Wa-al?”</p>

<p>“And if you won’t let us have your recipe, or tell
us where you got it, the only thing left for us to do
is to hire you.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ that you want me to work fur you?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Makin’ pickles?”</p>

<p>Poppy nodded.</p>

<p>“Um.... My business is towin’, not pickle
makin’.”</p>

<p>“You may find,” says Poppy, “that you can make
more money pickling than towing. For what you
take in from towing isn’t all profit. The wear and
tear on your outfit is considerable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“They hain’t no wear an’ tear on a mule.”</p>

<p>“Every time your mule shakes its tail,” says
Poppy, seriously, “a certain amount of physical energy
is used up. And to supply this energy you’ve
got to buy corn and oats. The more tail shaking,
naturally the more oats. That is what I call the
expense of upkeep. Or, in other words, the expense
of wear and tear.”</p>

<p>Old Butch was staring now. For this “wear and
tear” business, as applied to his mule, was a new
wrinkle to him.</p>

<p>“I swan!” he exploded. “What do you want me
to do, tie a flatiron to my mule’s tail so he kain’t
shake it?”</p>

<p>“The point is,” Poppy galloped along, “that you
can turn Jerusalem out to pasture if you work for
us, and nature’s grass will foot the wear and tear
bill. Then all you make will be profit.”</p>

<p>“I swan!” came again.</p>

<p>“The most we can afford to pay you,” says
Poppy, getting down to brass tacks, “is three-fifty
a day. Nor would we want to pay you any less, for
we’re going to keep you on the jump.”</p>

<p>As I have written down, Butch’s jobs, both towing
and house moving, are kind of few and far between.
So he hadn’t any thought of turning us
down.</p>

<p>“Um... Three-fifty a day, you say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ three dollars an’ fifty cents?”</p>

<p>Poppy nodded.</p>

<p>“Three dollars and fifty cents,” says he, “and
without any wear and tear.”</p>

<p>The gray eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“Got plenty of money?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“When do I start in?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“An’ you’re sure you’ve got plenty of money?”</p>

<p>Poppy laughed.</p>

<p>“If it’ll ease your mind any on that point we’ll
write you out a three-dollar-and-fifty-cent check
every night at quitting time.”</p>

<p>The old man let out his hairy neck.</p>

<p>“A <i>check</i>? Be you got a check book?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” says Poppy. “That’s a necessary
part of running the business.”</p>

<p>“I swan! Boys runnin’ ’round with check books,
when, gol ding it, I hain’t even got one myself.”</p>

<p>I jumped onto Poppy when we were outside.</p>

<p>“You sure are dumb.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong now?” came the grin.</p>

<p>“To think that you should go and hire <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“I had to in order to get pickles.”</p>

<p>“But you said yourself that no one in Tutter
would eat his pickles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“I said,” came the correction, “that pickles made
in his home wouldn’t sell.”</p>

<p>“If it’s your scheme,” says I, “to have him make
the pickles some place else, they’ll still be his
pickles. And that will queer them. For everybody
who knows him will take it for granted that the
pickles aren’t clean.”</p>

<p>“But, Jerry, they <i>will</i> be clean. For we’ll watch
him like a hawk.”</p>

<p>“It won’t work,” I shook my head.</p>

<p>The leader laughed. And right away I saw that
he had something up his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” says he, “did you ever notice the
picture of Aunt Jemima on the pancake flour?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. But what’s Aunt Jemima got to do
with our pickles?”</p>

<p>“We all know that Aunt Jemima is just a made-up
character. The same as the Cream of Wheat
man. As I understand it, such characters are used
in advertising and selling to give the product a sort
of personal touch. Just to look at the big grin on
Aunt Jemima’s face convinces us that her pancakes
are good. So we are led to think of <i>good pancakes</i>
instead of flour. Which is all to the point that if we
put this ‘Aunt Jemima’ scheme to work in our own
business our customers will be led to think of <i>good
pickles</i>, and the question of who made them may
never come up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>That kid! If he isn’t the limit. The schemes in
his head are thicker than mice in a corncrib. If
something bobs up to cripple one scheme he drags
out another. And if that one gets paralysis, or the
chilblains, he has still a third. To tell the truth,
this ‘Aunt Jemima’ stuff was all Greek to me. But
what of that? If he had the nerve to tackle it, and
take the responsibility, certainly I ought to be willing
to stand back of him and help him.</p>

<p>The decision having thus been arrived at that
Aunt Jemima was going to do some pickling as well
as pancaking, we shook hands on it, for good luck,
and then set out to buy a train-load of cucumbers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>MRS. O’MALLY’S PECULIAR FRIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> state geographies tell us that thousands of
years ago the valley in which our town is located
was the channel of a gigantic river that carried off
the huge overflow of the Great Lakes. As I understand
it Niagara Falls wasn’t doing business in
those dim and distant days. It would be interesting
to know just why the overflow stream got tired of
the old channel and started a new one. And, to that
point, what a bully sight the old stream must have
been. Certainly, if it were as deep as our sandstone
bluffs are high it was <i>some</i> river.</p>

<p>To-day the farmers raise corn on what used to be
the bed of the big river. It is from this rich “bottom
land,” as we call it, that the Tutter Canning
Company gets the most of its sweet-corn supply.
And it was into this farming section, so familiar to
us, that Poppy and I now turned our noses to see
about buying cucumbers.</p>

<p>Going south on River Street as far as the river
itself, a sluggish shrunken stream as compared to
what it used to be, we turned to the right into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
dirt road. The river on one side of us and the cornfields
on the other side were mostly hidden by horse
weeds three times our height. Pretty tall horse
weeds, huh? Well, if you ever come to Tutter in the
summer time I’ll show you some pretty tall corn,
too.</p>

<p>After a walk of two miles or more on the dusty
dirt road we came within sight of a two-story stone
house. Not only was it a very old house, with walls
two feet thick, as I very well knew, but it was
queer-shaped, with a steep roof. High above everything
else was a chimney that for size had it on any
house chimney for miles around. It was six sizes
too big for the work it had to do, but, of course,
having been built when the house was put up it
never had been changed.</p>

<p>It was to this lonely country place that Mrs. Cora
O’Mally had moved when her Tutter house burned
down, which fire I remember well, for that was the
night I swallowed a button that had gotten into my
bag of peppermint candy by mistake. As the insurance
had run out on her house, the widow
couldn’t rebuild. But when the Tutter people heard
that she was planning to move into the old Weir
house in the river bottoms, a place that had been
deserted for years and, in consequence, was almost
a wreck, money was quickly raised with which the
house had been fixed up. I might say here that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
certain young gink by the name of Jerry Todd had
helped to smash the old doors and windows. For
an old-time deserted house always attracts boys.
And of this particular house a lot of queer stories
were told. Holdups; bloody battles; even murder.
In fact, a number of superstitious people, believing
in ghosts, said at the time Mrs. O’Mally moved into
the old house that she was foolish. It was no place
to live, they declared.</p>

<p>To show you how a hard-working woman can fix
up a place, the yard, as we saw it to-day, was grassy
instead of weedy, with beds of blooming flowers
sprinkled here and there. Vines performed on
strings at the two porches. And another larger vine
with sharp fingers had clawed its way up the stone
wall to the roof.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally was in her big cucumber patch back
of the house. We could see her broad-brimmed
straw hat. There were smaller bobbing hats, too,
which told us that the pickle woman, as she was
called in Tutter, had already put a number of young
pickers to work.</p>

<p>“Unfortunate indeed is the aged body who has to
raise cucumbers for a livin’,” she straightened and
drained the sweat from her blistered face as we
stopped beside her. “’Tis hard work,” she added,
with a deep, weary sigh. “An’ the wonder to me is
that me ould back doesn’t give out entirely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“You surely have enough of them,” laughed
Poppy, looking over the big patch, now in its third
year.</p>

<p>“Enough, did ye say? Sure,” came the tired
smile, “I could fill all the pickle jars in New York
City an’ Chicago put together. There’s hundreds
of bushels. An’ with the job of pickin’ ’em, ’tis
mighty glad I am,” she beamed at us in her kindly
way, “to have the help of two more b’ys of your
size.”</p>

<p>I told her that instead of having come to pick
for her, as I had done the first summer she lived
here, we had come to buy. As pickle manufacturers
we might want thirty or forty bushels, I said, talking
big. And having ordered four bushels as a
starter, at two dollars a basket, we followed her to
the house and wrote out a check.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me,” says she curiously, sipping
a glass of cold water, “who’s goin’ to do the
picklin’ for ye.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Jemima,” laughed Poppy, who, I might
say, having but recently come to Tutter, never had
been in the stone house before.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally’s face showed plainly enough that
she didn’t know who “Aunt Jemima” was.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember,” I put in with a grin.
“Aunt Jemima is the colored lady who makes the
swell pancakes. She’s going to work for <i>us</i>, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>That, of course, puzzled her all the more. But
however curious she was we couldn’t very well tell
her the truth.</p>

<p>Though it was blistering hot in the sun the house
was cool, largely on account of its thick walls, I
suppose. So, seated comfortably, we were in no
particular hurry to leave. Besides, not having forgotten
that Mrs. O’Mally usually kept a supply of
swell cookies on hand, it might pay us, I figured, to
sort of stick around.</p>

<p>Suddenly something tipped over in the cellar. At
the sound the woman screamed, her hands clutching
the front of her dress. And turning to us, as white
as chalk, I saw, too, that she was trembling from
head to foot. Scareder eyes I never expect to see.</p>

<p>“There’s some one down there,” I cried.</p>

<p>“The cat,” she says, getting quick control of
herself. “Come,” she seemed anxious to get rid of
us. “Let’s go outside.”</p>

<p>“What the dickens?...” says Poppy, looking
back at the house from the dirt road. “Do you suppose
she’s got a prisoner down there?—or that some
one is hiding in the house?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was the old river pirate,” I joked.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Old Peg-leg Weir.” Then remembering that he
wasn’t posted on the strange history of the old
place, I explained: “He’s the man who built the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
house in the first place. Didn’t you notice how
queer it is?”</p>

<p>“I saw that it has unusually thick walls.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “and the farther down the walls
go the thicker they get.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I countered, “if you were a river pirate,
and liable to be surprised any minute by a posse,
wouldn’t you like to have plenty of secret doors to
jump through?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that there are secret doors
in the cellar walls?”</p>

<p>“That’s the story.”</p>

<p>There was a doubting laugh.</p>

<p>“You’ll be telling me next that there’s a ghost,
too.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says I cheerfully. “That was what
we heard.”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo!”</p>

<p>I then told my chum the complete story of the
old house as the tale had been handed down to me—how
old Peg-leg Weir and his band had preyed
on the early river packets, from one of which they
had taken a big treasure in gold that was being
brought up stream from St. Louis. Then had come
the death of the pirate chief, at the hands of an
angry posse, after which the band had been scattered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>The pirate’s treasure, I wound up, never had been
lifted, but lay exactly where its rascally owner had
hidden it. There were secret rooms under the queer
house, I said, and hidden doors in the stone walls.
It also was reported that there was a hidden tunnel
through which the pirate and his band had carried
their stolen gold from the river into the secret cellars.</p>

<p>“But tell me,” says Poppy, sort of pulling the
story to pieces in his mind, “if this is all true, how
does it come that the old house wasn’t long ago torn
down? For that would have proved or disproved
the story of the hidden rooms.”</p>

<p>“People were scared of the ghost.”</p>

<p>“Bunk!”</p>

<p>“On rainy nights,” says I, “is when it usually
comes out. For it was on a rainy night that old
Peg-leg Weir was drowned.”</p>

<p>“Drowned? I thought you just said he was shot
by a posse.”</p>

<p>“That’s <i>one</i> story. The other one is that he was
drowned in his bed. You see,” I ran off into my
usual nonsense, “he slept in the attic. There was a
knothole in the roof. And rather than have the
rain beat on his face as he lay in bed he shoved
his peg-leg into the hole. The rain swelled the
wooden leg so that it stuck tight. And the leg
being hollow, the water ran down inside of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
as though through a spout, and drowned him.”</p>

<p>“I’d as soon believe that story,” laughed Poppy,
“as the other one. Ghosts! Pooh! What we heard
in the house wasn’t a ghost. Nor was it a cat,
either.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” was my further nonsense, “Mrs.
O’Mally has a new husband. And she’s modestly
keeping him out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Shall we break the news to Mr. McGinty?”
grinned Poppy.</p>

<p>“I guess,” says I in good sense, “we’d better keep
our mouths shut. For whatever it was that we
heard it’s none of our business.”</p>

<p>“What puzzles me,” says Poppy, “is the way the
woman acted. The noise wasn’t a surprise to her.
Yet, if she knew what caused it, why was she so
scared?”</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> queer, I agreed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>READY FOR BUSINESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> weren’t so fed up on business stuff that we
had forgotten how to be boys, with a liking for the
kind of fun that is particularly boys’ fun. So, as
it was still early in the afternoon, and there was
nothing special for us to do in Tutter, anyway, we
headed for the river to do the usual mid-summer
“high-dive” and “who-can-bring-up-the-most-mud”
stuff.</p>

<p>Across the river we could see the high sandstone
bluffs, in the ravines and canyons of which are numerous
caves, some of which are fairly good size.
It’s odd, in a way, that there should be any “wild”
land in a section so completely crisscrossed with
hard auto roads as La Salle county. But if you
could see how deep and dangerous some of the river
canyons are you’d understand why so few people
go there.</p>

<p>Dressing after our peachy swim, I got my eyes
on an old log raft that had lodged in the willows.
There is only one thing that a raft is good for, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
when I tried to show my chum what that something
was I had the bad luck to skid into the river,
clothes and all.</p>

<p>And what gave Poppy all the more chance to
hoot at me was the smart gab that I had dished out
to him about “Washington crossing the Delaware.”
As a matter of fact, if I hadn’t acted the monkey
with my “posing” stuff I wouldn’t have ended up
with a wet shirt-tail. And what was even worse,
my pants accidentally burned up when we built a
fire to dry them.</p>

<p>But rather than stick around here until dark, I
started for home in a headless and bottomless barrel
that Poppy had found on the river bank. It was
fun at first. That is, I tried to let on that it was
fun. For lots of times when a fellow does that he
can take the gloom out of a bad predicament. But
with slivers puncturing me at every step I soon got
tired of it. Besides, this was no way for me to hit
town. If the Tutter kids spotted me they’d start
rolling me around as sure as pop. And how lovely
for me without any pants on!</p>

<p>“I’m going back to Mrs. O’Mally’s,” I told
Poppy. “And if I can’t do any better I’ll borrow a
nightgown.”</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard the muffled thump-thump-thump
of an approaching motor car. And having
no particular desire to be act “A” in the free vaudeville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
show, as it were, I frisked myself, barrel and
all, into a convenient cornfield.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the auto. Then it
stopped. Taking a guarded peek I saw that it was
one of the canning company’s trucks. And who do
you suppose was jacking up one of the hind wheels?
No one but little cutie, himself.</p>

<p>“Got a puncture?” I heard Poppy inquire pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Huh! Is it any of your business?” the hot-faced
worker looked up with a scowl.</p>

<p>“Makes you sweat, huh?” was Poppy’s further
pleasant contribution to the conversation.</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up.”</p>

<p>Having raised the wheel, the worker almost dislocated
a lung trying to loosen the rim.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid you’ll break it?” purred
Poppy.</p>

<p>“I’ll break your neck if you don’t shut up.”</p>

<p>The rim loosening suddenly, sweaty-face landed
on the back of his neck in the dusty road. But he
was up like a flash.</p>

<p>“If you laugh,” he screeched, grabbing a hammer,
“I’ll soak you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything to laugh at,” says
Poppy as sober as a deacon. “Did you hurt yourself?”</p>

<p>Smarty’s eyes didn’t lose any of their hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“If it’s time for you to go,” he shoved out, “don’t
let me detain you.”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” says Poppy earnestly,
“if I could get you to haul my barrel to town for
me.”</p>

<p>“What barrel?”</p>

<p>“It ran into the cornfield when it heard you coming.
But it’ll come out again if I whistle.”</p>

<p>Here was my chance to have some fun. Grabbing
several big ears of corn, and scrooching in my
barrel, I sort of poked the new ears on top of me.
This made it look as though the barrel was full of
green corn. Then, taking short steps, with my feet
out of sight, and one eye fastened to a slit in the
staves, I went out where the audience was.</p>

<p>Poppy almost fell over at sight of the “walking
barrel.” As for smarty, his eyes stuck out like
warts on a squash. But not being completely and
hopelessly dumb, he caught on as I made a circle
of the truck. And <i>mad</i>! Say, when I did the jack-in-the-box
stuff on him, with the same kind of a
hee-haw that he had handed to us at the bank, I
thought he’d peg the whole truck at me.</p>

<p>“He’s heading for Mrs. O’Mally’s house to get
a load of cucumbers,” I told Poppy, when the truck
had gone on down the dusty country road.</p>

<p>“The dickens! Do you suppose he’ll take all
she’s got and make us wait?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“We paid her for four bushels with the promise
that they’d be ready for us any time after four
o’clock. And from what I know of her I don’t
think she’ll go back on her word.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” says Poppy, “I’d like to make
sure. For we need those cucumbers. So, as you
were going back there anyway to borrow a nightgown,
let’s follow him. We needn’t show ourselves.”</p>

<p>Winding up our legs, we soon were back within
sight of the stone house. And sure enough, as I
had told Poppy, the canning factory truck was
pulled up beside the cucumber patch. Ducking
into a cornfield that skirted the big patch, we
stopped at the sound of voices.</p>

<p>“No,” says Mrs. O’Mally, “them four baskets
are sold. I can’t let ye have ’em.”</p>

<p>“But I want all you’ve got,” insisted the important
acting truck driver.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. But the other two b’ys was ahead
of ye.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?—that Ott kid and young
Todd?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They bought them four baskets an’ paid
me for ’em.”</p>

<p>Smarty gave a mean laugh.</p>

<p>“Some more of their ‘Pickle Parlor’ stuff, I suppose.
A bunch of junk. <i>Them</i> run a business and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
get away with it? Say, they couldn’t draw a
picture of a straight line and do a good job of it.
Let me tell you something, old lady: you’re crazy
to sell pickles to kids like them when you’ve got
a big responsible company like ours to deal with.
For when we buy we buy big.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the pickle woman gave the bragger a
dig, “an’ at half the price that other people pay
me.”</p>

<p>“A dollar a bushel is a good price.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so if ye had to pick ’em.
Look at me ould back. ’Tis bent like the twisted
willows that ye see on the river bank.”</p>

<p>Smarty made himself as important acting as he
could.</p>

<p>“As it happens you’re luckier then you realize
to get even a dollar a bushel from us. For
at first the talk was in the office of paying you only
ninety cents a bushel this year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” Mrs. O’Mally was getting mad
now, as her words and actions showed. “’Twas
all decided in your office, was it? I had nothing
to say in the matter at all.”</p>

<p>“Buying cucumbers is purely a matter of business
with us. To make money we’ve got to buy
right. Hence we set our own price.”</p>

<p>“An’ is it on the same plan that ye buy the
bottles?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Do ye say to the bottle man: ‘I’ll pay so much.’
Or does <i>he</i> set the price on his own goods?”</p>

<p>“That’s different.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came bitterly, “the difference is that
you’re dealin’ with a firm as smart as yourselves an’
not with a helpless ould woman.”</p>

<p>Smarty didn’t like that.</p>

<p>“Say!...” he swelled up. “We aren’t trying
to cheat you. They’re your cucumbers, and you
don’t have to sell them to us if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“You know I have no other place to sell ’em.”</p>

<p>“That’s your lookout. If you didn’t want to
have them to sell you shouldn’t have raised them.”</p>

<p>“The young smart aleck,” gritted Poppy, when
the truck, with its small load, had disappeared in
the direction of town. “He ought to have his
mouth slapped for talking that way to an old lady.”</p>

<p>“I never knew before,” says I, sort of thoughtful-like,
“that all Mrs. O’Mally got from the canning
company for her cucumbers was a dollar a
bushel. Why, after paying for the picking it’s a
wonder to me that she makes any money at all.”</p>

<p>Poppy took in the length and breadth of the big
cucumber patch.</p>

<p>“I wonder how many bushels of cucumbers she’ll
have to sell this year.”</p>

<p>“Six-seven hundred probably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Gee!” and his eyes were like stars. “Wouldn’t
it be slick, Jerry, if we could buy the whole shooting
match ... at two dollars a bushel?”</p>

<p>I gave a squeak.</p>

<p>“<i>Us</i> buy seven hundred bushels of cucumbers?
You’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he nodded thoughtfully, “we
couldn’t sell that many pickles in Tutter. I realize
that. But why couldn’t we do business in other
towns?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t shut up,” I told him weakly, “I’ll
die of heart failure. <i>Us</i> handle seven hundred
bushels of cucumbers? Good night nurse! Old
Butch couldn’t can seven hundred bushels of
cucumbers in seven years.”</p>

<p>Having borrowed a pair of big-waisted trousers
from the scarecrow in Mrs. O’Mally’s strawberry
patch, I put on a clever little “Charlie Chaplin”
program going home. I thought I was rather funny
myself. But from Poppy I got about as much attention
as a goldfish in a crowded menagerie. I
suppose, though, had I been a cute little cucumber
it would have gotten a loving smack on the forehead.</p>

<p>Cucumbers! That’s where his mind was, all
right. He was completely and hopelessly buried
in cucumbers.</p>

<p>That night after supper my chum and I borrowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Dad’s auto and drove into the country, getting our
first load of cucumbers. As it had been decided to
establish our pickling headquarters at Poppy’s
house, the cucumbers were taken there. And the
next morning the pickling began.</p>

<p>But before we let old Butch touch the cucumbers
we led him over to the kitchen sink and introduced
him to the soap dish and a basin of water.
Poppy washed first, to show how it was done; then
me; after which, of course, the pickle expert had
to follow suit. But he didn’t like it for two cents.</p>

<p>“I swan!” he grumbled. “Anyone would think
from all the pernickety washin’ an’ wipin’ that’s
goin’ on that we were gittin’ ready to give a swell
party. Don’t you know that if a feller’s hands is
dirty he’ll git ’em washed clean when he messes
’round in the pickles? So what’s the use of goin’
to all this extra trouble?”</p>

<p>“But you aren’t so liable to get chapped hands,”
says Poppy, like the tactful little piece of cheese
that he is, “if you wash in warm water.”</p>

<p>The pickle maker gave a snort.</p>

<p>“Chapped hands in the summer time! I swan!
You’ll be tellin’ me next to wear woolen socks to
keep from gittin’ the chilblains.”</p>

<p>“Here,” says Poppy, frisking out a stiff white
butcher’s apron that his pa had used on an earlier
meat-market job. “Try it on and see how it fits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Old Butch let out his neck at the curiosity.</p>

<p>“You mean,” says he, “that you want me to <i>wear</i>
it?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“But what’s it fur?”</p>

<p>“To keep you from getting your pants dirty.
And here’s a nice little white cap to go with it.”</p>

<p>That was more than Butch could stand.</p>

<p>“I come here to make pickles,” says he stiffly,
“an’ not to be made a monkey of in a dunce cap.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d like the cap,” says Poppy.
“For all professional pickle makers wear white
caps. So let’s put it on, anyway, and see how it
fits.”</p>

<p>“I feel like a fool,” grunted Butch, squinting with
shame at the reflection of himself in the kitchen
mirror.</p>

<p>“Now,” says Poppy, “we’re all ready to go to
work.”</p>

<p>Old Butch started across the run and stopped.</p>

<p>“By the way, you hain’t up an’ spent all your
money, be you?”</p>

<p>“I should say not.”</p>

<p>“Um.... An’ it was to be three-fifty a day,
you said.”</p>

<p>“Three dollars and fifty cents a day,” nodded
Poppy. “And you get your pay every night, if you
wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“In cash?”</p>

<p>“Cash or check. Whichever way you say.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I’ll take the cash. Fur I kain’t
make it seem right in my mind that they’s anything
sartin ’bout my pay in workin’ fur two boys.”</p>

<p>The first step in pickle making, we learned, was
to wash and sort the cucumbers. So we took out
those that we thought were too big or too small.
I helped to scrub the cucumbers with a hand brush.
Then we rinsed them in several changes of water.
Having bought two metal tubs, we scrubbed these
as clean as a whistle and filled them with salt
water, after which we put the cucumbers to soak in
the “brine,” as the pickle maker called it.</p>

<p>This was on Saturday. Nothing happened on
Sunday. And on Monday the pickle maker took
the cucumbers out of the brine and soaked them in
different changes of fresh water. I never dreamed
that you had to give a cucumber so many different
kinds of baths before it was a pickle—my idea
was that you put the cucumbers on the stove to
cook and when they had cooked an hour or two
they were pickles. But Butch seemed to know his
business. So, much as we hated to let the work
drag along, we didn’t try any hurry-up stuff with
him.</p>

<p>On Tuesday he had us buy a whole list of stuff—alum,
sugar, cider vinegar, celery seed, allspice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and stick cinnamon. And don’t imagine, either,
that we bought a dime’s worth of each, or anything
like that. I guess not! The junk cost us
exactly eleven dollars and forty-five cents.</p>

<p>To put the Tutter people wise to how good our
pickles were, Poppy had worked out a sample
scheme, and having for this purpose bought three
hundred drug-store bottles, just big enough to hold
four pickles each with the cucumbers packed on
end, he and I were deep in the job of washing and
scalding these bottles when who should come into
the house on the tear but old Mr. Ott.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” he says, ripping off his coat and giving
it a throw, “why didn’t you remind me that this
is the day?”</p>

<p>“What day?” says Poppy in surprise. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, this is the Thursday my nepher in Rockford
gits married. An’ to git there in time fur the
weddin’ we’ve got to catch the eleven o’clock train.
So hurry, now, as it’s twenty minutes to eleven
already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee, Pa!” Poppy objected to being dragged
away from his beloved pickles. “Do I have to go?”</p>

<p>“You most certainly do. Fur they asked me
special to bring you along.”</p>

<p>“But I ought to stay and help Jerry. For see the
work there is to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Go git your Sunday clothes on like I tell you an’
quit arguin’ with me. Fur Henny is the only
nepher I’ve got. So it’s our family duty to be there
when he gits hitched up.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later old Butch and I had the
house to ourselves. But now I was ordered to clear
out of the kitchen by the secretive pickler, who had
no intention of letting me see how he mixed up the
liquid dope that gave the pickles their swell taste.
That, he said, was the secret part of the work.</p>

<p>The following morning I got a telegram from
Poppy. His father, he wired, having eaten too
much wedding cake was sick in bed. “Go ahead
and distribute the samples,” the telegram instructed.
“I’ll surely be home to-morrow or Sunday.”</p>

<p>Some of the pickles were in pint and quart jars.
But the most of them were in a barrel that we had
gotten at a grocery store. They sure were swell-looking
pickles, all right. But—oof!—I couldn’t
bring myself to eat any of them. Even to handle
them in packing the sample bottles almost gagged
me.</p>

<p>One thousand and two hundred pickles having
been put away quartet style in the three hundred
bottles, I did the corking and label sticking, after
which I borrowed a neighbor’s pushcart and set out,
leaving a sample bottle and a handbill at every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
house in our end of town. I think you’ll agree with
me that Poppy’s printed handbill was pretty slick.
Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="large">AUNT JEMIMA’S PICKLES</span></p>

<p>Every housewife knows how good Aunt
Jemima’s pancakes are. And now we have
cucumber pickles of the same wonderful quality—Aunt
Jemima’s pickles—home-made, with
a taste you’ll never forget.</p>

<p>Here at last are the perfect pickles you long
have dreamed of, the kind of pickles that you
never could quite make in your own kitchen.
And the secret, of course, is in the secret
recipe!</p>

<p>We know that when you have sampled these
marvelous pickles you will want more. And
the only place where you can buy them—in the
bulk at 20¢ a dozen, and in sealed-tight glass
jars at 35¢ a pint and 65¢ a quart—is at</p>

<small>THE WORLD TIPS OVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever notice how crazy some people are
to get something for nothing? A free show always
gets a big hand no matter how punk it is. And
however much some women may hate cornflakes,
if a tiny package of breakfast food is tossed on
their front porch it’s dearer to them than gold.
Zip! Out they come to grab the sample almost before
it stops rolling. I found this out one time
when Red Meyers and I tagged a sample peddler
around with the clever little scheme in mind of
snitching his stuff behind his back. But we didn’t
get very much. For the women for the most part
were too quick for us.</p>

<p>To make sure of my own samples, I waited, after
knocking, until the woman of the house came to the
door. Then, giving her the pickles, together with a
handbill, I politely recited my little speech, as I had
memorized it ahead of time. Nor was there any
frisky broom-swatting stuff this trip. As a matter
of fact, I think Mrs. Bagley was very sorry for
having swatted me. For she saw now that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
a young business man. And there is a big difference,
you know, between swatting an ordinary kid
over the head and a young business man.</p>

<p>I missed Poppy’s help. For our store had to be
moved. And it had been his intention to sort of
boss the moving job while I dished out the samples.
As it was, I had both jobs to do.</p>

<p>Running home at six o’clock, as hungry as a bear,
I found a note from Mother telling me that she and
Dad had gone over to the Methodist church to
a chicken-pie supper. Chicken pie! Um-yum!
What I wouldn’t do to that chicken pie, I told myself,
pocketing the four bits that they had left for
me. But eager as I was to wrap myself around a
nice hunk of white meat smothered in gravy, I had
the good manners to stop and wash up. I put on a
clean shirt, too. For it wasn’t to be forgotten that
I was now in business for myself.</p>

<p>It sure was a swell supper. But an old lady
who had to listen through a tin pan almost spoiled
the feed for me by passing me pickles. And, worse,
they were greasy stuffed olives. Oof! Instead of
taking one I asked her to please park the dish under
the table.</p>

<p>I was up bright and early the following morning,
having arranged with old Butch to do the store
moving before the other people were out of bed.
Hearing us in his yard, Mr. Weckler got up to help.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
But there wasn’t much that he and I could do except
to look on. For the moving job, as Butch went
at it with his wheels and other truck, was no trick
at all. At six-thirty our store was properly set
down, close to the sidewalk, in the vacant lot across
the street from the cannery.</p>

<p>People who worked in the factory stopped on
their way past to rubber at us. And I heard a lot
of laughing talk back and forth about the new
“Pickle Parlor.” Then who should roll up to the
curb in a truck but little cutie, himself.</p>

<p>“You’ve got your nerve,” he lit into me, “moving
this junk into our parking lot.”</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> lot?” says I, going ahead with my work of
arranging pickle jars on the shelves. “How do you
get that way? This is Mr. Weckler’s lot.”</p>

<p>“Well, even so, we’ve got a better right to it than
you.”</p>

<p>Stepping back, I gave a critical eye to my finished
work.</p>

<p>“Looks swell, doesn’t it?” says I, moving one jar
a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p>“Say!... Did you hear what I said?”</p>

<p>“YES!” I boomed at him in the same thundering
voice. “I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. But what
you say doesn’t amount to much. So, unless you
want to buy some pickles, go outside in the sun and
make a shadow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Here another auto came as far as the curb and
stopped.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” says Mr. Norman
Pennykorn, coming into the store with a dark face.
“Who gave you permission to move this nonsensical
building onto our lot?”</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to let him bluff me.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Weckler’s lot. And he told us that
we could use it.”</p>

<p>“We need the lot for our cars.”</p>

<p>I asked him then why he didn’t park his cars
on their own property across the street, which made
him mad.</p>

<p>“In our business,” he swelled up, figuring, of
course, that this would scare me to death, “we
aren’t in the habit of explaining to <i>boys</i> why we do
this or don’t do that. The point is, we object to
having such a ridiculous outfit as this moved in
front of our office. And, further, we need the lot
for our own use. So, if you are wise you’ll have this
building taken back where it came from.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but wish that old Poppy were
there. For he can wind up his gab to match anybody’s.</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t move out,” says I. “What
will happen to us?”</p>

<p>“We’ll buy the lot and force you out.”</p>

<p>Well, there wasn’t anything that I could say to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
that. Certainly, if they wanted to buy the lot, and
Mr. Weckler was willing to sell it to them, we
couldn’t stop the deal. But what made me hot was
the thought that they had waited until now to do
their buying. It looked like spitework to me. Still,
it was hard for me to believe that a big business man
like Mr. Norman Pennykorn would act that way
with a couple of boys.</p>

<p>This, as you will remember, was on Saturday
morning. And as Saturday is always a busy day
in the stores I figured that we ought to sell a lot of
pickles. But at eleven-thirty I hadn’t taken in a
penny. Then, who should breeze in but old Poppy,
himself.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says he, looking around. “This sure
is the berries. How’s business?”</p>

<p>“Rotten,” says I.</p>

<p>“When did you open up?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“Peddle the samples?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t had any business in result?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“The only two people who were in the store all
morning were young Pennykorn and his father.
And they came to order us out.”</p>

<p>The returned one pricked up his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Order us out?” says he. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Getting the story, he hurried down the street to
learn from the lot’s owner if the property had been
sold. But he soon came back into sight. And was
he ever stepping high!</p>

<p>“We’re all right, Jerry. Mr. Weckler says they
can’t buy the lot now if they offer him ten times
what he asked them for it in the first place. It
seems he was sore at them for parking their cars
here. And a month or so ago he told them that if
the lot was so necessary to them in their business
they’d better buy it. But you know how tight they
are. What was the use of spending a thousand
dollars for the lot, was their idea, when they could
get the use of it for nothing? So they never bought
it. And now Mr. Weckler is tickled to think that
we crowded them out. He’s on our side strong.
They just offered him twelve hundred for the lot.
But he told them that, having rented it to us, it
wasn’t for sale.”</p>

<p>I was out in front when smarty got into his truck
to go home to dinner. And you should have seen
him glare at me. But I stepped around as big as
cuffy. We should worry about <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>As Mr. Ott had decided to stay in Rockford for a
few days, which left Poppy alone, I had him go
home with me to dinner. Mother was all excited.
Half of the town was sick, she said. Since his first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
call at midnight, Doc Leland hadn’t had time to
draw an extra breath.</p>

<p>“What is it?” says Poppy. “Some kind of an
epidemic?”</p>

<p>“Ptomaine poisoning, as I understand it.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I put in the afternoon at the store.
And still no customers. We couldn’t understand it.
Was the scheme all wrong? It would seem so.
Still, we hung on, how could it be wrong?</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I suggested, “we ought to sort of go
out and look for customers instead of waiting for
them to come to us.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that?” says he.</p>

<p>“We might be able to sell a pile of pickles if we
went from house to house.”</p>

<p>That was well worth trying, he agreed. So, leaving
him to run the store, I started out with a loaded
market basket on my arm.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown,” says I at the
first house. “You probably remember me,” I
beamed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she snapped. “I remember you <i>well</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon,” says I, wondering what
had upset her, “I gave you a sample of our
pickles—”</p>

<p>“<i>Pickles?</i>” she cut in. “Do you mean to call
those filthy things <i>pickles</i>?”</p>

<p>I stared. Then a horrified thought sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
swooped down on me. I hadn’t tasted the pickles!
Could it be that something was wrong with them?</p>

<p>I got out of the yard as quickly as I could. And
hurrying to the nearest alley, out of sight, I unscrewed
the top of a pint jar. Stiffening myself,
to overcome my gaggy feeling, I took a bite. And
then—</p>

<p>Well, say! I spit that pickle clean over the top
of Denny Kirk’s barn. For if I must tell you the
truth it was the rottenest pickle I ever had tasted in
all my life. The wonder to me was that I didn’t
heave up my whole insides.</p>

<p>Cutting down the street to the store, I found my
chum with his face buried in a Chicago newspaper.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says he, looking up at me with eyes as
big as saucers, “did you eat any of the new
pickles?”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven <i>no</i>!” I yipped, running to the
door to spit.</p>

<p>“It would be awful,” he wiped his sweaty face,
“if any of the people were to die.”</p>

<p>“Die?” says I, going cold. And then the truth
of the matter dawned on me, too. <i>It was our
pickles that had done the poisoning!</i></p>

<p>My knees giving out, I sat down. And it was then
that my chum showed me the article in the evening
newspaper. It wasn’t much—just three or four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
lines in small type. But it sure told the whole
story.</p>

<p>Over a hundred patients were being treated by
Tutter physicians for ptomaine poisoning, the result
of eating contaminated pickles, the newspaper
said. The state board of health was expected to
act on the case immediately.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE GOLD CUCUMBER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poppy</span> and I were in a bad fix. There were no
“if’s” or “and’s” about that. Not only was our
pickle business shot sky high, but we were liable to
end up in jail. In fact, it was something of a wonder
to us that we weren’t already in jail.</p>

<p>Plainly enough something had gone wrong with
the pickle making. While we were running around
with a microscope looking for specks of dirt, old
Butch had gotten hold of the fly poison or furniture
polish by mistake. From the way the pickles tasted
I could imagine, too, that he had dumped in an old
rubber boot. Anyway, something had gotten into
the pickles that didn’t belong there. And it was
this something, whatever it was, that had poisoned
them.</p>

<p>But the mere fact that the pickle maker, himself,
had pulled the boner didn’t let us out. Not at all.
For he was just a hired part of our business. As
its owners, we would be held responsible.</p>

<p>Oh, how dumb we had been to let him go ahead—sloppy
old coot that he was—without checking up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
on every little thing that he had done! We realized
that now. But a fellow it seems always realizes
those things when it’s too late, like the time I sent
the homely valentine to the teacher. Ouch!</p>

<p>Old Butch, we learned, on sending a message into
Zulutown, had gone up the canal on a towing job.
So we had no chance of finding out from him how
the poison had gotten into the pickles, or what
it was. To that point, though, the chances were
ten to one he couldn’t have told us, anyway.
For it wasn’t to be believed for a single moment
that he had known that there was poison in the
pickles. He was sloppy and dirty. But he wasn’t
a fool.</p>

<p>The same kid who brought us word of the closed
Zulutown house carried a note to Mother in which
I explained that Poppy and I wouldn’t be home for
supper. Eat? Say, we hadn’t any more appetite
than a seasick totem pole.</p>

<p>It came dark. And finally we locked up the store
and went down the street. Nor did we try to hide
when we saw the marshal coming. For we realized
that our medicine was waiting for us. So we might
just as well take it first as last.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” says Bill Hadley, as friendly as you
please. “Sellin’ lots of pickles?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Poppy, with a face as long as the day
before Christmas, “we haven’t sold any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Which hain’t to be wondered at,” says Bill.
“Fur them four samples that you left with my wife
was the rottenest pickles that ever sneaked into a
glass bottle. What’d you flavor ’em with?—fumigated
sauerkraut?”</p>

<p>“Jerry thinks it was an old rubber boot,” Poppy
grinned weakly.</p>

<p>“Um.... No rubber boot ever taste that
bad.”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky,” says I, wishing he’d light into us
and thus end the suspense, “that you didn’t eat
them. For if you had you’d be in bed to-night along
with the rest of the people.”</p>

<p>That seemed to surprise him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” says he, looking at me
curiously.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard,” says I, surprised in turn,
“about the people being poisoned?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “the pickles did it. So if you
had eaten them <i>you</i> would have been poisoned,
too.”</p>

<p>He scratched his head.</p>

<p>“What pickles are you talkin’ about?” says he.</p>

<p>“Why, our pickles, of course.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t your pickles that poisoned the
people. It was them stuffed olives that they had at
the church supper last night. I hear, too, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
hain’t expectin’ old Miz Higgins to pull through.
Too bad! Too bad! That’ll give church suppers a
black eye fur the next ten years.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I blew in a dollar and seventy cents
that night celebrating. Oh, boy, did we ever have a
grand and glorious feeling! First we stocked up
with candy and popcorn. Then we went to the
movie show. After the show we had three dishes of
ice cream apiece and two malted milks. That is,
I had two. Poppy, though, kind of petered out on
his second one.</p>

<p>But when we got home we sort of parked our
hilarity under the bed. For it wasn’t to be forgotten,
the leader said, serious again, that our pickle
business was none the less of a fizzle. And to find
out just how heavy our loss was he got out his expense
book. Here is a list of the money that we had
spent:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“It might have been worse,” says I, trying not
to feel downhearted over the loss of our money.
“We’ve got thirty-two dollars left and the two tubs.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know the worst,” says Poppy,
sitting on the edge of the bed with his chin in his
hands.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” says I, suddenly struck
by the fact that he was acting unusually downcast.</p>

<p>“Prepare yourself for some bad news, kid.”</p>

<p>“Have we lost the thirty-two dollars, too?” I
squeaked.</p>

<p>“Worse than that.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t joking. I saw that plainly enough.
In fact, he seemed to be downright worried. I
never had seen him that way before. So I got
worried, too. But to all of my eager questions
he shook his head. He’d tell me the tale of woe
in the morning, he said.</p>

<p>During the night the hall light outside of our
bedroom was switched on, and sitting up in bed,
blinking, I saw Doc Leland waddle past the door,
jiggling something in a glass. He had been called
to the house, I learned, to see Mother, who, having
gotten a pain in her stomach in the middle of
the night, had hysterically jumped to the conclusion
that she, too, had been poisoned. But all she
had was a touch of indigestion.</p>

<p>Hearing me talking with Dad in the hall, Doc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
waddled out of the sick room to inquire how my
stomach pains were. I was all right, I said.</p>

<p>Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling went the ’phone in the
lower hall.</p>

<p>“It’s for you, Doc,” Dad presently called up the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Doc wheezed into the machine when he
got to it. “This is Leland. What’s that? Who?
Oh!... Old Mr. Weckler. Yes, I’ll be right
over. Now, don’t let yourself get flustered, Miz
Clayton. Jest keep cool an’ do the best you can
for him till I get there. You won’t have to wait
many seconds.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Weckler sick, too?” Dad inquired.</p>

<p>“Miz Clayton says some one tried to murder
him.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Dad.</p>

<p>“It’s her story that she found him lyin’ in the
library in a pool of blood. Robbery, I s’pose.
Well, let’s hope I get there in time to save him.”
There was some hurried talk about Mother’s medicine.
She would be all right by morning, Doc said.
Then the front door slammed.</p>

<p>I got my chum out of bed in a jiffy.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” says I excitedly.</p>

<p>“What?” says he, looking at me sleepily.</p>

<p>“A robber broke into old Mr. Weckler’s house
to-night and tried to murder him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Poppy bounced three feet.</p>

<p>“Quick!” says I. “Jump into your clothes.”</p>

<p>Lucky for us we were of a size. For in the
scramble to get dressed I got his pants and he got
my shoes. Nor were we completely buttoned up
until we were halfway down the block.</p>

<p>Except for the sounds that we stirred up ourselves
as we skinned along on the toes of our
rubber-soled shoes, the empty streets were as silent
as their own deep shadows. And while it was mid-summer,
with the days soaked full of heat, there
was now a damp feeling in the air that sort
of cranked up our shivering apparatus. Maybe,
though, it wasn’t so much the night air that gave
us the shivers as it was the excitement.</p>

<p>Murder! That’s the worst kind of a crime that
can be committed. And if it were true, as Mrs.
Clayton had told Doc over the ’phone, that an
attempt had been made to kill old Mr. Weckler in
his own home, then there was in Tutter a criminal of
the worst sort. Naturally, Bill Hadley would be on
the job. For, as town marshal, this was work in
his line. There would be a quick search for clews;
then, no doubt, an exciting arrest. As we had
helped Bill before, and to very good results, too,
as you should well know if you have read my books
about the “Whispering Mummy” and the “Purring
Egg,” we were quite sure that he would let us help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
him on this job. As a matter of fact, we felt that
it was our duty to help him. For wasn’t Mr.
Weckler our “silent” partner? Furthermore, if the
same robber, in earlier work, had been in Poppy’s
house, as we both thought, certainly Bill ought
to know about it.</p>

<p>Our pickle store got scarcely a glance from us
as we went by on the run. And a moment or two
later we tumbled into the yard in front of the old-fashioned
house of which we had seen so much
lately, but over which now a cloud of mystery
hung. There were bright lights in the downstairs
windows. And the front door was open.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances we didn’t stop to knock.
Nor did Doc or Mrs. Clayton seem at all surprised
when we tumbled in on them. As a matter of fact,
I think they were glad to see us. For, with the
housekeeper shivering and shaking, we supplied
the help Doc needed to get the unconscious man
onto the library couch. Blood! His head was
bloody and there was blood all over the floor. I
even got my hands in it. Ough! It sort of sickened
me.</p>

<p>“Some hot water,” says Doc crisply, “an’ make it
snappy.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I got the water for him. For we
could move faster than the housekeeper. To tell
the truth, she wasn’t any help to him at all. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
for fear that he might have her on his hands, along
with the injured house owner, he ordered her to
back up into a chair and stay there.</p>

<p>Later the still unconscious man was carried upstairs
and put into his bed, after which Doc telephoned
for a trained nurse. Mr. Weckler was in
mighty bad shape, we learned. Even if he lived it
probably would be necessary to operate on his skull
to give him back the use of his mind.</p>

<p>“When he comes to,” Doc told the nurse, who
got there just as the clock struck three, “he’ll
prob’ly be as crazy as a loon. So be right here beside
the bed. For if given a minute he may do hisself
serious harm.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be here,” says the nurse grimly.</p>

<p>In ordering the housekeeper back to bed, Doc
mixed up some kind of dope to settle her nerves.
And then, when everything was quiet in the house,
he waddled into the library and thumbed through
the ’phone book for a number.</p>

<p>“It’s time now,” says he, “to call in the law.”</p>

<p>An open window showed how the unknown robber
had gotten into and out of the house. Going
outside we found heel prints under the window.
Here, too, our flashlight picked up the carcass of
Mr. Weckler’s yellow cat. Stone dead, Poppy said.
Running ahead, he followed the escaping robber’s
tracks in the soft grassy earth. Coming to a flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
bed, around which I now vaguely remembered that
a heavy wire had been strung, I saw him drop to
his knees. For the robber, it seems, striking the
knee-high wire in his flight from the house, had gone
kerplunk! on his snout into the flower bed. The
imprint of his right hand showed plainly, but,
strange to say, there was no left-hand imprint.</p>

<p>The silence of the sleeping street was broken by
the rattle of a flivver. Then a shaft of light cut
across the yard in a sweeping circle. Bill Hadley
having arrived, I started forward to meet him with
the story of our discoveries. But a cry from Poppy
stopped me.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Look! Here’s money that flew out of
the robber’s pocket. Fifty cents and three quarters.
Here’s a knife, too. And here’s something
else.” There was a short silence. “Well, I’ll be
cow-kicked! What do you know if it isn’t a cucumber!
A <i>gold cucumber</i>!”</p>

<p>I was back in two jumps. A gold cucumber!
What in time did he mean by that? I soon found
out. For he had the object in his hand. A sort
of pocket piece, about an inch long and as heavy as
lead, it had been cast in the perfect pattern of a
cucumber.</p>

<p>We knew now that the robber was one-armed;
that for some strange reason he hated yellow cats;
and that he had a particular interest in cucumbers.</p>

<small>THE CAT KILLER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next hour Bill Hadley did a lot of
noisy stomping around. For that’s his way of
working. He has the idea, I guess, that it makes
him seem important.</p>

<p>But so far as I could see no new clews were
added to the ones that we already had picked up,
except that he found out the truth about the dead
cat. And right here comes a strange part of my
story. Can you imagine a one-armed man strangling
a cat? If a job like that were wished onto me I
think I’d need <i>six</i> hands. For I know something
about cats! How then had this geezer managed
it one-handed? And awful as it was to think about,
an act so inhuman as that, why had he done it?</p>

<p>No doubt it was all imagination on my part, but
during the time that we were in the yard, hedged
in as we were by a black thicket of crouching
bushes and quivering overhead leaves, I had the
shaky feeling that a pair of burning eyes were
secretly watching us. But we could pick up nothing
with our flashlights. I was glad, though, to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
inside. Walls gave me a safer feeling. A one-armed
cat killer! Br-r-r-r! None of that grab-it-by-the-neck-and-drag-it-around
stuff for me.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Weckler’s library safe, Bill said, that
had gotten the burglar’s eyes. But so far as we
could see the safe hadn’t been opened, which led us
to the belief that the defeated housebreaker had
been scared away right after the attack.</p>

<p>“The dum cat is what gits me,” says Bill, all
tangled up in that angle of the mystery. “I kin
understand the attack on old Weckler—the chances
are he heard noises below an’ come down here to
investigate, to the unfortunate result that we already
know—but I kain’t fur the life of me figure
out why the geezer killed the cat. Did he do it first
off on coming into the house, to keep it from yowling?
Or did he do it after beanin’ the old gent?
An’ why in time did he <i>strangle</i> it? If he wanted
to kill it, why didn’t he jest whack it in the head?”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the first queer thing that the robber
has done,” says Poppy. “For the other night he
broke into our cellar and strewed pickles all over
the floor.”</p>

<p>“It could ’a’ bin the same geezer,” waggled Bill,
on getting the whole story. Then he walked around
shaking his head, as though he were more puzzled
than ever.</p>

<p>At four-thirty old Mr. Weckler was no closer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
consciousness than when we had carried him upstairs,
so there was no hope of getting any early
help from him on the mystery. The nurse told us
that steps were being taken by the doctors for an
early operation. The poor old man! I kind of
choked up when I looked at him, so still and white.
I thought of the time my dog was run over by the
garbage wagon. And I wished with all my heart
that this awful accident hadn’t happened. For he
had been good to us. In fact, few men would have
done the things for us that he had done. For most
men are too busy with their own work to give much
thought or help to a boy’s schemes.</p>

<p>We solemnly buried the dead cat beside the
onion bed in the weedy garden. It was daylight
now. And as there was nothing more for us to
do here, as I could see, I passed the suggestion to
Poppy that we beat it for home and have a beauty
nap. But he shook his head, telling me that he
wanted to stay here and have an early talk with
Mrs. Clayton, who was sleeping off the effect of
Doc’s medicine. Getting his promise to meet me
at Sunday School, I went off with Bill in the
flivver. Dad got up when he heard me come in.
And learning that Mother was sleeping, I quietly
slipped into my own bed. Nor was I more than five
or six minutes getting my snoozer cranked up.</p>

<p>I was up again at nine-thirty. And after a late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
breakfast of my own making I dolled up in my best
duds and sashayed down the street to the Methodist
church. People in the street were talking with
considerable excitement about the attempted robbery.
But I didn’t say anything. For a good detective
doesn’t run around blabbing his stuff.</p>

<p>Presently I met Mr. Stair.</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, thinking that he was pulling
something clever, “how’s Aunt Jemima this morning?”</p>

<p>I felt like telling him, “None of your beeswax.”
But I held in. For a boy doesn’t gain anything
by being sassy to older people.</p>

<p>But when Bid Stricker percolated into the summer
scenery and tossed some more of the “Aunt
Jemima” stuff at me. I took after him lickety-cut
I couldn’t run him down, though, for I had on my
tight leather shoes. So I gave him a few rocks to
remember me by. One of these flying rocks went
kersmack! into the tin stomach of Doc Leland’s old
Lizzie as it gurgled around a corner. Gee! Doc
almost swallowed his false teeth. Then, in the
thought that he had a blow-out he socked on the
brakes with such force that his hat and nose glasses
shot right over the top of his head into the back
seat.</p>

<p>“Just my confounded luck,” he wheezed, throwing
the jack and other tire tools out of the car. Carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the jack from wheel to wheel, and finding all
four tires full of air, he stood and stared.</p>

<p>“I’ve had punctures,” he rumbled, “that I never
heard. But this is the first time I ever heard one
that I haven’t got.”</p>

<p>Grinning, I asked him how Mr. Weckler was.</p>

<p>“<i>Him?</i>” he slam-banged the jack and other stuff
into the back of the car on top of his straw hat.
“Oh, he’s jest about the same. Opened his eyes
once an’ started talkin’. But it was stuff we
couldn’t make any sense of fur the most part.”</p>

<p>“And he hasn’t told you yet who hit him?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>At the church Poppy led me quickly into the
basement, as he wanted to talk with me in secret
behind the furnace.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” came excitedly, “I’ve found out something.
Did you know that this river pirate of yours
used to raise cucumbers?”</p>

<p>“Who? Old Peg-leg Weir?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Clayton told me about it. And later on I
got the full particulars from old Mr. Hartenbower.”</p>

<p>Mr. Silas Hartenbower, I might say, is a centenarian,
or whatever you call it. Last June the
whole county turned out to celebrate his one-hundred-and-second
birthday. That was the afternoon
Red Meyers and I made the bet to see who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
could eat the most pink ice cream. The big pig!
He won.</p>

<p>“I didn’t take much stock in that pirate story
when you first dished it out to me,” says Poppy.
“For it sounded fishy. But when Mrs. Clayton told
me about the pirate’s <i>cucumbers</i>—and when I
heard about the <i>iron mold</i> from Mr. Hartenbower—oh,
baby!”</p>

<p>Here a big yellow cat meandered around the furnace
and took a curious squint at us. It strangely
reminded me of Mr. Weckler’s cat. But when I
reached down to pet it, it ran and jumped into an
open window, the sill of which was on a level with
the outside yard.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Hartenbower’s story,” says Poppy,
“that old Peg-leg Weir covered up his unlawful
river work for years by making a pretense of raising
cucumbers for a living. Every summer he had
a big bed of cucumbers back of his house—probably
in the very same place where Mrs. O’Mally
has her big patch. As he always had plenty of
money, the neighbors got the idea that his cucumber
seed brought a fabulous price. Hence the
cucumbers were something extra-special, they
thought. But the patch was left strictly alone when
one farmer, who tried to snitch a peck or two of
the cucumbers to get some of the seed for his own
use, went home with a charge of bird shot in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
legs. That was Mr. Hartenbower, himself, then
only twenty-two years old. The next winter the
truth came out about the pirate. A posse of angry
farmers surrounded his house, determined to
capture him, and it was then, I was told, that he was
shot down. Some battle, I guess. Mr. Hartenbower
searched the house for cucumber seed.
Couldn’t find a one. He did find a queer iron mold,
though. Out of curiosity he later filled it with
melted lead. And when he took the lead piece out
of the mold, what do you suppose it was?”</p>

<p>“Bullets?” says I, remembering stories I had
heard about early pioneer days.</p>

<p>“No,” he shook his head, “it wasn’t bullets. It
was a little cucumber, about an inch long.”</p>

<p>I stared at him. And I could feel my eyes growing
as big as his.</p>

<p>“As you can imagine,” he ran on, “I almost fell
off my chair when old Mr. Hartenbower told me
about the lead cucumber. For the truth fairly
jumped at me. Our gold cucumber was a part of
the pirate’s hidden treasure! Cucumbers having
been his hobby, he had made a mold in which to
cast his gold in the shape of little cucumbers,
though what his object was I can’t imagine. But
he did it—I’m dead sure of that. Gold cucumbers!
Hundreds of them probably. If only we can find
them. Eh, Jerry, old pal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Upstairs, in the opening of Sunday School, they
were singing “Love Lifted Me.” So, with the pipe
organ booming away like a bull with a burr under its
tail, and a hundred kids yipping out the “Love-Lifted-Me”
stuff at the top of their voices, I felt safe
in doing some excited yipping myself. Treasure
hunters! That’s what we were now. And to think
only a few hours ago we had let ourselves get excited
over a dinky little pickle business! Why, if
we could find the pirate’s gold cucumbers we’d
have a thousand times more jack in our pockets
than a pickle store would earn for us in a thousand
years. Automobiles! Airplanes! Motor boats!
Candy and ice cream by the ton! We could buy
<i>anything</i>, no matter what it cost. For gold cucumbers
would be worth as much, pound for pound, as
gold money. We knew that, all right.</p>

<p>The cat that I have mentioned, after washing itself,
had gone to sleep on the sunny window sill.
And now, as a long iron thing, like a pair of tongs,
came stealthily through the window, inch by inch,
and closed, with a snap like a fighting dog’s teeth on
the furry neck of the luckless animal, I let out a
screech that must have lifted the whole Sunday
School to its feet.</p>

<p>Then, to my further horror, the struggling, gurgling,
choking cat was whisked through the window
and out of our sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>MRS. O’MALLY’S “GHOST”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> this day Poppy tells the crazy story that I
screeched so loud that I rocked the furniture. And
the wonder is, he further kids me, that the pipe
organ didn’t streak it for the front door. Which
is all bunk, of course. Still, it is to be admitted
that I <i>did</i> break up the Sunday School. Following
a babble of excited voices, we heard quick footsteps
coming toward the basement door. Then the
door opened. But by this time the leader had his
head in the window.</p>

<p>“Quick!” says he, going over the sill on his
stomach. To hurry me along he got down on his
knees and gave me his hands. I have a hunch that
whoever led the way down the stairs caught a
glimpse of my flying legs as I went out through the
window. But that was nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Getting to my feet, the first thing I did, of
course, like Poppy, was to look around for the cat
killer. But, to my surprise, there was no one in
sight. Determined not to let the fellow get away
from us, we scooted, tandem-style, around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
church. Still no success. Nor could we see anybody
in the street except two gray-haired ladies in
an old-fashioned buggy who were arguing in the
deaf-and-dumb language over which hitching post
they should use: the one in front of the church or
the one at the parsonage. Next we ran to the alley,
where we saw plenty of ash cans, but nothing on
two legs except a junky-acting rooster.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” panted Poppy. “Where
in Sam Hill did he go to, anyway?—into the earth?”</p>

<p>This new stuff tangled us up worse than ever.
If the man had been listening to us, as seemed probable,
considering how very careful he had been to
keep back out of sight, why had he jerked the cat
through the window? Was it to scare us?</p>

<p>But how strange, to go deeper, that he had been
so close to us when we least suspected it! Still, on
that point, all of his actions had been strange. In
many ways he was as mysterious as a shadow, itself.</p>

<p>A cat-strangling machine! Ugh! The poor cat
had been given no chance at all. But if the mystery
of <i>how</i> he did his cat strangling had thus been
cleared up to us, we had yet to learn <i>why</i> he did it.</p>

<p>Having upset the Sunday School, we decided that
it was a good place to keep away from. So that was
one Sunday that the church didn’t get our two
dimes. Our plan now was to see what information
we could pick up at Mrs. O’Mally’s house. And as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
we had a long dusty walk ahead of us on the bottom
road, we hurried home and changed our clothes.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you,” says Poppy, when we were
headed for the river, “about my talk with Mrs.
Clayton. She was awakened, she said, by a cat
scream—as she describes it, a most hideous scream.
Thinking that the house cat was in trouble, she
started downstairs, but as Mr. Weckler was ahead
of her on the stairs she went back to bed. Just
as she was dozing off she heard a cry; then something
fell. She almost fainted, I guess, when she
saw what had happened in the library. And as soon
as she could, of course, she got Doc on the telephone.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell her that Peter is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I took her outside and showed her
the grave, so that she could tell Mr. Weckler about
it when he got up.”</p>

<p>I thought then of our early-morning work. Bill
had wondered whether or not the cat had been
strangled before the attack on the old man or afterwards.
We knew now, from what Mrs. Clayton had
told Poppy, that it was the cat’s death cry, itself,
that had gotten the awakened owner out of bed.
Yet the puzzling question still hung before us:
<i>Why</i> had the housebreaker killed the cat? What
had been his object? Having invented some kind
of a fearful cat-strangling machine, was it a mania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
of his, or whatever you call it, to go around killing
harmless cats? And, if so, did he sometimes pick
off bigger stuff than cats? Boys, for instance, or
even grown men? Of these thoughts, I had the
sudden shivery feeling that Poppy and I, as treasure
hunters, had best watch our “P’s” and “Q’s.”</p>

<p>Coming within sight of the old stone house at
exactly twelve o’clock, the leader suddenly was reminded
of something.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry, I haven’t told you yet about the bad
news.”</p>

<p>That was so! In the morning’s excitement I had
forgotten all about it. But I wasn’t particularly
worried.</p>

<p>“It can’t be any worse than the rotten pickles,”
I grinned. “So spit it out.”</p>

<p>“Last Thursday when I was in Rockford, my
cousin, who works in a wholesale grocery store, took
me down to the office to meet the boss. Our talk
was mostly about cucumber pickles. Mr. Wiggins
was very much interested in our new pickle business.
I spread a lot of gab, I guess. And what do you
know if I didn’t talk him into giving me an order for
two thirty-gallon barrels! Being Henny’s cousin
helped, I suppose. Anyway, whether it was that or
just my line of gab, I got the order. Boy, did I
ever feel big! If we could sell barreled pickles to
him, my imagination began to jump around, why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
couldn’t we sell them by the barrel to other wholesalers?
I was sure that we could. And so that we
would have plenty of cucumbers to work on, and
thus be able to fill the whopping big pickle orders
that we were going to get, I telegraphed to Mrs.
O’Mally, telling her that we’d buy her whole cucumber
crop.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” I squeaked, staring at him.</p>

<p>“At two dollars a bushel.”</p>

<p>It was so much worse than what I had expected
that I lost my voice. I could only stare. Finally,
though, I got my voice back again, after a lot of
gurgling and neck-stretching. I tightened up my
wabbly legs, too. And remembering that he was
my best pal regardless, I shoved out a fumbling
paw.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says I, wondering what made it so
blamed hot all of a sudden, “since I’ve known you
you’ve made some beau-tiful high dives. But this
is one time, kid, when you sure landed flat on your
little tummy. Seven hundred bushels of cucumbers
at two dollars a bushel! Wow!” I drew a deep
breath. Boy, it sure was hot! “But it’s you and
me, kid,” I went on, pumping his arm up and down,
with the sweat running. “That’s the way we
started; and that’s the way we’re going to finish.”
Then I tried to be enthusiastic. “Anyway,” says
I, “who knows but what we may be able to think up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
a scheme for making cucumber watch charms or
fancy green doo-dads for ladies’ hats? So don’t
start twiddling your thumbs now, old hunk. Use
your beezer. It looks just as good to me as it ever
did ... on the outside. And if you can’t get
action any other way, swallow a bumblebee.”</p>

<p>We were walking slower now.</p>

<p>“What are we going to tell Mrs. O’Mally?” says
he, looking ahead.</p>

<p>“Why not wait and see what she tells us?”</p>

<p>“But suppose she asks us for money?”</p>

<p>“Write her out a check,” I made a big gesture.
“We still have thirty-two dollars in the bank.”</p>

<p>He sort of squeezed my arm.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says he, “you’re a little brick. I really
didn’t think you’d take it so—so cheerful-like. In
fact, considering how I had jumped into it without
telling you, I thought you’d be a little bit sore.
And I was all ready to have you pounce on me and
call me a dumb-bell.”</p>

<p>Lots of times we slam-bang the “dumb-bell” stuff
at each other in fun, as I have written down. But
to call that kid a dumb-bell in earnest would be
like telling a lily to go out in the kitchen and wash
its face. No, sir, a dumb-bell was one thing he
wasn’t. <i>Ambition</i> was what had tripped him up.
His ideas were too big for his shoes. So, in a way,
it isn’t to be wondered at that he had taken a flop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Of course, as his partner, he should have gotten my
advice before ordering the cucumbers. But I wasn’t
going to crab at him on that point. For he always
took the lead, anyway. And any scheme to save
us would come out of his head, not mine.</p>

<p>Having passed into the well-kept yard, I took a
squint out back, expecting to see a young cucumber
mountain. But nothing of that kind was in
sight. Nor were the pickers at work, this being
Sunday.</p>

<p>A few chickens ran out to meet us, as though
expecting to be fed, and at the side porch a big cat
jumped out of a chair. Rapping on the screen door,
we heard footsteps. Presently Mrs. O’Mally came
into sight.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she invited, holding the door open.
In the careful housekeeping way that many women
have, she brushed out a fly or two with her apron.
“I was wonderin’,” she added, looking at us warmly,
“if ye wouldn’t be out to-day to see your cucumbers.
’Tis a whole cellar full that I have for ye.
Come! I’ll show ’em to ye.”</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry,” says Poppy, noticing that
the woman had gotten up from the dinner table.
“We’ll just sit down and wait till you’re through
eating.”</p>

<p>There’s something particularly fine about Mrs.
O’Mally. Like Mother. When you’re around her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
you sort of have the feeling that she likes you and
wants you to know about it. Of course, she probably
doesn’t like everybody. But I know that she likes
me! So I wasn’t surprised when she warmly insisted
on us sitting up to the table and eating dinner
with her. Nor did we refuse. For that wouldn’t
have been polite.</p>

<p>“Sure,” she bustled around, getting more stuff out
of the kettles on the stove, “’tis a much finer dinner
I would have had for ye could I have known ahead
of time that ye would be likely to drop in on me at
this particular hour. But if ye have to skimp on
the taters ye can have your fill of bread an’ jam.
Then, too, ’tis a fine three-layer cake I have in the
pantry. An’ pickles! Sure, I can give ye plenty of
<i>them</i>. An’ all fresh made, too.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” I grinned. “I’m not eating pickles
to-day.” Nor did Poppy, I notice, show any interest
in the pickles.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” says he, galloping into the food,
“that the man who built this house used to have a
big cucumber patch out back where your patch is?”</p>

<p>Coming out of the pantry with more bread on a
plate, Mrs. O’Mally let the slices fall to the floor.
And seeing her face, as it turned white at mention
of the pirate, I kicked the leader under the table.
She knew secret stuff, all right!</p>

<p>Later she took us down a flight of heavy stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
into the deep, dungeon-like cellar, where a week’s
picking from the big cucumber patch had been put
into one huge bin. One hundred and thirty bushels,
she said proudly. I could imagine that she was
saying “two hundred and sixty dollars” in her mind.
And all we had in the bank was thirty-two dollars!</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says she, “that you’ll be comin’ after
’em soon.”</p>

<p>Poppy didn’t say anything. He felt kind of
sneaking, I guess. But, to that point, until we knew
for sure that we were up a tree there was no sense
in alarming her.</p>

<p>“Had I not known Jerry’s pa and ma so well, I
might have hesitated to save the cucumbers for ye,
as the telegram said. But ’tis confidence I have a-plenty
in the Todd family. For who give me the
fine woolen blankets for me bed last winter, when
the snow was tin feet deep between here and the
river road? No one but Miz Todd, herself. An’
who come with a truck-load of coal, even shovelin’
his way? Ye should know, Jerry, for ’twas that
elegant pa of yours. Sure, I wanted to pay him for
the coal, but would he take a penny? Not him! He
had coal goin’ to waste in the brickyard, he said, like
the magnificent liar that he is, an’ it was a great
accommodation to find some one who could make
good use of it.” The old woman was dabbing at her
eyes with the corner of her apron. “Yes, Jerry,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
she put a trembling hand on my shoulder, “’tis a
fine pa and ma that ye have. An’ if ye say ’tis me
entire cucumber crop that ye want, God bless ye ’tis
yours for the askin’. I can even wait for me money,
if necessary.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything. But I was doing a lot of
deep thinking. <i>This</i> showed how lucky a boy was
to have a good pa and ma. Mrs. O’Mally trusted
me because she trusted my folks. Old Poppy, I
stiffened, as I saw where my duty lay, simply <i>had</i>
to squeeze a winning scheme out of his beezer now.
There were no “if’s” or “and’s” about that. For I
saw that if we skidded on paying for the cucumbers
it would be just the same as throwing dirt on the
fine family reputation that Mother and Dad had
been carefully building up all these years.</p>

<p>Tap! Tap! Tap! It was a slight sound. Faint
and far-away. And under ordinary circumstances
I might not have noticed it at all. For frequently
sounds of no consequence carry a long distance in
the earth, like the time in the Higby-ravine cave
when we heard a farmer’s water-pumping engine
almost a mile away. This, though, was no such
sound as that. It was more like even rock-hammer
blows. Tap! Tap! Tap! Some one near us was
working underground.</p>

<p>There was a cry from Poppy. And I wheeled to
find him supporting Mrs. O’Mally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Help me, Jerry. She’s fainted!”</p>

<p>There was some excitement then, let me tell you.
But, to the woman’s good fortune, her fainting spell
wasn’t anything serious. Having carried her upstairs,
she opened her eyes when we sprinkled water
on her. And soon she was sitting up, quite as well
as ever, except that she looked peculiarly white.</p>

<p>“This,” says she, in a weary voice, “is the end.
I’m goin’ to move. I can stand it no longer. For
me nerves is a wreck.”</p>

<p>Then, to our amazement, she told us a strange
story of ghostly raps and muffled hammer blows in
the cellar walls. It had started about a month ago,
she said. At first she had thought that it was rats.
But she soon changed that belief. For no rats could
have made the peculiar sounds that she heard, both
day and night. Nor did the sounds, as she grew
more familiar with them, seem earthly to her, which
led to the superstitious conclusion that the house
was indeed haunted. What she heard was a ghost!
No doubt the ghost of the dead pirate, himself! Yet,
poor as she was, and alone in the world, she had
tried to fight down her fright. For if she let the
ghost drive her out of the house she had no place
else to go. Then, too, the fear of ridicule had kept
her from going to the neighbors with her story.</p>

<p>We told her then about the gold cucumber and
the things connected with it. What she had heard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
we said excitedly, wasn’t a ghost, but the one-armed
cat killer who was searching in the secret cellars of
the old house for the balance of the pirate’s hidden
treasure, of which, no doubt, the one gold cucumber
that he had found was the key.</p>

<p>“Mither of Moses!” she cried, with terrified eyes.
“A cat killer, did ye say? ’Tis this very day I’ll
move out of here.”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Mrs. O’Mally. We aren’t
going to let him harm you. In fact, we’re going to
stay right here with you until we find out the truth
about this queer old place. So, there now!” he
further comforted her. “Just forget about your
fears. And on top of taking good care of you, if
we <i>do</i> find the hidden treasure, you’re going to get
a third of it. Don’t forget about that.”</p>

<p>Here a swell roadster drove into the yard.</p>

<p>“Young Pennykorn and his grandfather,” Poppy
rubbered.</p>

<p>“The ould skin-flint,” says Mrs. O’Mally, watching
the banker with unfriendly eyes as he got out
of the car and started stiffly toward the house. “He
has let me pile up cucumbers all week, thinkin’ that
he could come here to-day an’ Jew me down. I
know <i>him</i>. But thank the good Lord this is one
time when I’m safe from his clutches—graspin’ ould
miser that he is!”</p>

<small>THE BANKER’S THREATS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Mally</span> got all ready to go to the door,
expecting to hear the visitor knock. But instead,
after a searching glance at the house, which made
us think that he was wishing in his grasping way
that he could chuck it into his pocket and make off
with it, as another one of his possessions, he continued
his stiff-legged walk in the direction of the
big cucumber patch.</p>

<p>Rubbering through the kitchen window, we saw
him go the full length of the patch on one path and
back on another, stopping every few steps to poke
around among the green vines with a stick. Once
he picked a cucumber and bit into it. Evidently it
suited him, for we could see him nod his head. His
curiosity satisfied at the patch, he stopped at the
car on his return to say a few words to his cute
little grandson, who was half asleep in the comfortable
seat, after which he came on to the house, rapping
authoritatively at the front door.</p>

<p>Poppy and I, of course, kept out of sight. For
the banker’s business with Mrs. O’Mally wasn’t our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
business. So the admitted visitor didn’t know that
we were in the same house with him.</p>

<p>“I have been out back inspecting your cucumber
patch, Mrs. O’Mally,” the conversation began, and
while the speaker was seated out of our sight we
could imagine from the tone of his voice how very
dignified he looked. This was a trick of his, of
course, wealthy man that he was, to make Mrs.
O’Mally feel sort of insignificant. “The patch seems
somewhat larger to me this year.”</p>

<p>“I added two acres.”</p>

<p>“The same seed, I judge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p>“You are having unusually good luck with cucumbers,
Mrs. O’Mally.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not so much luck, sor, as patience an’ hard
work.”</p>

<p>“The vines, I noticed, are set full, with every
prospect of a heavy yield.”</p>

<p>“With no bad luck from the weather, I expect to
pick at least seven hundred bushels.”</p>

<p>“Seven hundred bushels!” The man made it
sound like an ocean full. “How many bushels was
it that we bought from you last season?”</p>

<p>“Four hundred an’ fifteen.”</p>

<p>“An increase of almost three hundred bushels!”
There was a short silence. “I’m wondering, Mrs.
O’Mally,” then came thoughtfully, “if our factory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
will be able to handle your entire crop. For you
realize, of course, that our pickle line is somewhat
of an experiment. And hence, at the start, it would
be rash for us to go into it too heavily.”</p>

<p>“I was told, sor, that your new pickle line was a
big success.”</p>

<p>“Of course; of course. We have nothing to complain
of. But, still, we are not established in that
branch. Far from it. So we must proceed with
proper business caution.”</p>

<p>“Which, I take it, is to the p’int that ye hain’t
wantin’ me whole crop.”</p>

<p>“I—ah—would want to confer with my son, Mrs.
O’Mally, before definitely committing myself. Still,
it is not improbable that Norman will be able to
shape his production plans so as to absorb your
entire crop of seven hundred bushels or thereabouts,
providing, of course, that the price is right.”</p>

<p>“Ah!...” The pickle woman’s voice had a
stiffer tone. “Then ye think I’m gettin’ rich too fast
at a dollar a bushel.”</p>

<p>“Here is the situation, Mrs. O’Mally: On one
hand we have what promises to be an over-supply of
green cucumbers, which, of course, is your problem.
On the other hand an unwise over-supply of high-priced
pickles would be our problem. So, as I see
it, the thing for us to do, to your best interests and
to ours, is to get together on a price that will enable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
us to buy your whole crop, to save you loss from
waste, and also without risk to ourselves. We can
do it in one of two ways: The first four hundred
bushels will be priced at a dollar a bushel, as this
will be the cream of the picking, the next hundred
bushels at ninety cents, and the balance at seventy
cents, which will give you, net, six hundred and
thirty dollars for the total estimated crop of seven
hundred bushels, or an average of—ah—ninety
cents a bushel. That is one plan, as I say. The
other plan would be to pay ninety cents straight, in
which case we would agree to take all you have,
even if the crop runs as high as eight hundred or
even nine hundred bushels. I trust I am not confusing
you with these figures.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what ye mean, all right,” came
bluntly. “You’re tryin’ to get me cucumbers for
ninety cents a bushel.”</p>

<p>“Everything considered,” the oily voice went on,
“that is, I am sure, a very fair price. As I say, it
protects you from possible loss through waste, and
it protects us in case we have to cut our price to the
jobber on account of unwise over-production. The
question is, will you be willing to accept ninety
cents a bushel, with the understanding, of course,
that we will absorb your entire crop? Or will you
want to look around for another possible market?
We have no strings on you, Mrs. O’Mally, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
you can sell your crop elsewhere, for more money
than we can afford to pay you, that is your privilege.
As a matter of fact, with your best interests
at heart, I wouldn’t want to see you lose a penny
on our account. It is our misfortune, seemingly,
that we can pay you no more, much as we would
like to do so. But, as our pickle business is in its
infancy, as I have mentioned, we must be properly
conservative.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I hadn’t missed a single word of the
old geezer’s gab. He sure had a slick line, all right.
But he didn’t fool us for one minute.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him, Jerry?” a whisper
came in my ear.</p>

<p>“He’s an old liar.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it surprise you?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to surprise <i>him</i>,” I gritted, as Mrs.
O’Mally’s friend.</p>

<p>“I guess he’d be surprised, all right,” came
the grinning reply, “if he knew we were listening.”</p>

<p>In calling the banker an old liar I was thinking,
of course, of the business conversation we had overheard
in the bank. Not only was the new pickle
line a whopping big success, if we were to believe
what we had heard, but convinced that this success
would keep up, and steadily grow bigger, the company,
as we knew, had already made plans to start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
up a separate pickle factory in Ashton. And here
he was letting on to Mrs. O’Mally, in his smooth,
oily way, that her cucumbers would be a drag on
his hands. Just to get more wealth!</p>

<p>Money is bully good stuff to have. When I grow
up I’m going to earn a lot of it and get a lot of fun
out of it. But, bu-lieve me, if I ever try to earn a
penny by cheating another person—least of all a
poor old woman—I hope somebody with decency
will meander into sight and crack me a good one
on the back of the bean.</p>

<p>So, having separated myself from this little spiel,
you know what <i>I</i> thought about Mr. Foreman
Pennykorn!</p>

<p>And not a bit sorry was I now that we had the
big cucumber crop on our hands, though, as I have
written down, when Poppy first sprung the news on
me I had taken it as a sort of calamity. It would
be fun to turn the cucumbers into money under the
banker’s very nose. I hadn’t any idea how we were
going to do it. But I had the fighting feeling, all
of a sudden, that we could do it. Old skin-flint, as
Mrs. O’Mally called him. We’d fix him.</p>

<p>“’Tis glad I am to hear ye say, Mr. Pennykorn,”
the pickle woman went on with the conversation,
“that ye would like to have me sell me cucumbers
where I can get the best price for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Not for one minute, Mrs. O’Mally, would we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
want to stand in your way,” purred the old fraud,
who, of course, was chuckling inside over the smug
thought that his factory was the only market that
the cucumber raiser had. “For we always want to
do what is right and fair to all. That is our policy.
Sometimes the farmers think our prices are too low.
But it is a fact that we always pay as much as we
can. Yet, I know how the farmers feel. Money is
money to all of us. And I dare say that a hundred
dollars means even more to a poor person, and particularly
to an old lady like you, than to a struggling
business such as ours.”</p>

<p>A “struggling business!” And he and his son had
talked of “cleaning up” fifty thousand dollars in
this one year alone! Of all the two-faced old
skunks!</p>

<p>“An’ how much was it that the seven hundred
bushels would bring me at ninety cents a bushel?”
Mrs. O’Mally inquired.</p>

<p>“Six hundred and thirty dollars.”</p>

<p>“An’ it would honestly please ye, ye say, to know
that I could sell me cucumber crop for more than
that?”</p>

<p>The banker hadn’t expected this question.</p>

<p>“Six hundred and thirty dollars is a lot of money,
Mrs. O’Mally. And if you have any thought of
looking around—”</p>

<p>“I have no need to look around, sor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Fine! We will use you right, of course. For, as
I say, that is our fundamental policy.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me, Mr. Pennykorn. I said
I have no need to look around. For me entire crop
has been sold.”</p>

<p>Right then, I guess, is when old pussy-foot got
the surprise of his lifetime.</p>

<p>“<i>Sold?</i>” he choked, springing stiffly to his feet.</p>

<p>“At two dollars a bushel,” says Mrs. O’Mally, as
sweet as you please.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the banker hadn’t any voice.</p>

<p>“Madam, is this true?”</p>

<p>“Can ye doubt it, sor, to see me happy face?
Fourteen hundred dollars as ag’inst six hundred an’
thirty dollars! Sure, I feel rich. An’ ’tis fine, Mr.
Pennykorn, to know that ye are glad with me.”</p>

<p>Well, say! When Poppy and I heard that we
almost busted right out. For you can imagine how
“glad” the banker was. Oh, yes, he was about as
glad as you would be if your folks sent you down
town to the dentist on your birthday to have three
or four teeth pulled.</p>

<p>“Mrs. O’Mally,” he drew himself up, as we could
see by watching him in the kitchen mirror, “you had
no right to sell your cucumber crop to an outsider
without first consulting us.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” says the woman, pretending innocence,
“ye take a strange view of me good fortune, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Pennykorn, considerin’ how anxious ye was a moment
ago to have me sell where I could get the
most money. ’Tis almost displeased that ye act,
sor.”</p>

<p>“You know that we were figuring on your cucumber
crop.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the lack of it is goin’ to cripple ye, ye
may be able to get the new buyers to divvy up with
ye.”</p>

<p>“At two dollars a bushel? We’ll never pay such
an outrageous price!”</p>

<p>Here footsteps sounded on the side porch. And
wheeling, who should Poppy and I see in the door
but young smarty. His eyes sure stuck out when
he saw us. Then around the house he went on the
tear, tumbling in through the front door.</p>

<p>“Hey, Grandpop! That Ott kid and monkey-face
Todd are listening in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Monkey-face!</p>

<p>“Get me an ax,” says I, rolling up my sleeves.</p>

<p>Poppy showed himself.</p>

<p>“There he is, Grandpop. That’s him. He’s the
kid who started that Pickle Parlor in front of our
office.”</p>

<p>The banker looked startled for a moment or two.
Then his face darkened.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he thundered.</p>

<p>But it takes more than a rumble to scare Poppy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“The meaning is,” says he, “that you’re an hour
and fifteen minutes late. For having gone into the
pickle business ourselves, and needing a big supply
of cucumbers, we got here ahead of you and contracted
for Mrs. O’Mally’s entire crop.”</p>

<p>The banker’s eyes were blazing now.</p>

<p>“Do you realize that you are directly interfering
with a hundred-thousand-dollar corporation?”</p>

<p>Poof! A hundred thousand dollars wasn’t anything
to excite Poppy.</p>

<p>“What of it?” says he.</p>

<p>The man swallowed.</p>

<p>“<i>What of it!</i>” he boomed, his temper getting away
from him more than ever. “Young man, we’ll take
this nonsensical business of yours and crush it under
our heel like an egg shell.”</p>

<p>“If you go stepping on us,” says Poppy, “you
may find that we’re egg shells with hard-boiled centers.
And instead of crushing us, you’re liable to
skid and jar the kink out of your whiskers.”</p>

<p>Boy, oh, boy, was that man ever furious!</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for this insolence,” he further thundered.</p>

<p>“You bet your boots,” smarty bounced in. “You
can’t monkey with us. For we’ve got money.”</p>

<p>“Money doesn’t count for much,” says Poppy,
giving the kid a dig, “if you haven’t got brains to
go with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Mrs. O’Mally’s a fool to sell her cucumbers to
you kids. For she’ll never get her pay. You with
your rotten pickles!” he turned up his nose at us.
“A pig couldn’t eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” says I. “Are you the pig
that tried?”</p>

<p>The banker now turned on Mrs. O’Mally.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you until to-morrow noon to cancel your
silly negotiations with these boys and sign your
entire crop over to us.”</p>

<p>“No signature will ye get from me at ninety cents
a bushel.”</p>

<p>“Unless we can come to these terms we’ll sue you
for breach of contract.”</p>

<p>“We have no contract.”</p>

<p>“We have a verbal understanding. And that will
hold good in law.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally was getting mad now.</p>

<p>“Scoundrel!” she cried. “Get out of me house
before I take a broom an’ chase ye out.”</p>

<p>“Try putting us out,” smarty swelled up, “and
see what you get.”</p>

<p>“A chip of the ould block,” Mrs. O’Mally handed
it to him.</p>

<p>“Why not make it a chip of the old blockhead?”
I put in, which wasn’t very nice of me, I know, considering
that the crack partly hit an old man. But,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>ding bust it, I’ve never been sorry to this day that
I said it. For what that old cheat tried to do to us!</p>

<p>“I’ll soak you for that,” flared smarty.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and soak,” I dared him.</p>

<p>The banker started off.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he shot at Mrs. O’Mally, “you have
until to-morrow noon to come to our office and sign
our contract. As for you, you young whippersnappers,”
he turned on us, with eyes full of hatred, “I
give you your orders now to drop this interference
in our business affairs and move that Pickle Parlor
of yours back in the alley where it came from.”</p>

<p>“<i>Some</i> Pickle Parlor!” smarty threw at us.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I shot back at him, “and I know a guy
about your size who’ll have <i>some</i> hump on the end
of his nose if you don’t hurry up and do the evaporating
act.”</p>

<p>“Say, kid,” says he, swelling up like a fighting
rooster, “let me whisper something to you: Every
morning before breakfast I strangle six guys bigger’n
you are just to get up an appetite.”</p>

<p>Monkey-face! I couldn’t get that out of my
mind.</p>

<p>“When you get to town,” says I, “go around by
the undertaker’s and pick out a coffin. For I’m
going to get <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the car shot out of the yard
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“The scoundrel!” cried Mrs. O’Mally, white and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
trembling, but still mad enough to bite a tenpenny
nail in two. “<i>Me</i> sign his paper? I’ll go to the
poorhouse first.”</p>

<p>“You won’t need to go to the poorhouse,” says
Poppy, “if we can find the pirate’s treasure.” Then
he motioned to me. “Come on, Jerry. Let’s get
busy.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>UNDERGROUND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Putting</span> the Pennykorn gang out of our minds
for the time being, Poppy and I again took up the
peculiar puzzle of the one-armed cat killer. He sure
was a big hunk of mystery, all right. The crazy
things that he had done in Tutter you already
know about. Less than three hours ago, after having
followed us to the church, he had given us the
slip in broad daylight. And here he was in the
secret cellars of the pirate’s house pounding away
with his tack hammer as unconcerned as you please,
seemingly with as little fear of detection as he had
shown at the church. Had he followed us here, too?
Or had he left town ahead of us? We wondered.</p>

<p>What he was after, of course, in this secret work
of his, was the balance of the hidden treasure. Having
found one of the gold cucumbers he naturally
wanted the whole caboodle. To believe Mrs.
O’Mally’s story, he had been working here, like a
hidden ghost, for a month or more. That he was
still on the job, with a tap! tap! here and a tap!
tap! there, as the old scout song goes, proved that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the crafty pirate had put his treasure away in some
peculiarly secure place. But where had the man
gotten his clews to the hidden treasure in the first
place? Further, where was the secret entrance to
these mysterious underground rooms that enabled
him to come and go in broad daylight without detection?
And, most puzzling of all, considering his
cat-killing mania, who was he?</p>

<p>With nothing in the cellar now except green cucumbers
and silence, we were led to believe that the
mysterious worker had gone off somewhere to take
a rest. So we got busy and did some extensive wall
tapping ourselves, with the big hope, of course, that
we would be successful in locating a hollow section
in the heavy masonry. But the guy who did the
needle-sleuthing stuff in the haystack had an easier
job than us. For those cellar walls sounded about
as hollow as a butcher’s chopping block. The secret
doors, it would seem, were a myth.</p>

<p>As I have written down, the cellar was deep and
dungeon-like. It was full of creeping shadows, too.
Shadows that had twisting octopus arms one minute
and spider-like legs the next. I didn’t like it for
two cents. I kept thinking of that iron jigger that
had grabbed the poor cat. And other stories of
murders believed to have been committed here ran
through my mind. Sniffing, I could almost imagine
that the dank air was heavy with the smell of blood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Like a slaughterhouse. However, when I told
Poppy what I was sniffing about he said that it was
a dead-rat smell, after which he went upstairs, in
further wall tapping, but to no better success.</p>

<p>We then went over the outside walls inch by inch,
not only tapping, but searching, as with a microscope,
for a possible secret door, on the order of
those amazing secret doors that we bumped into
while working on the mystery of the spotted gander,
as related in an earlier book, POPPY OTT AND
THE GALLOPING SNAIL. At the end of our
work we were dead sure that there were no secret
doors here. So, unless the man got into the hidden
rooms from within the house, which seemed impossible,
the only other view to take was that he did
the trick from underground.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me something about a tunnel,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard there <i>is</i> a tunnel,” I answered.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t seen it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I shook my head.</p>

<p>If there <i>was</i> a tunnel leading from the river to the
stone house, with a secret entrance at the cellar end,
certainly we ought to be able to find it, the leader
said. But here again we bumped our noses against
a solid brick wall, as the saying is. And after an
hour’s unsuccessful search up and down the shore
of the river, where the bank for the most part was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
nothing but a mud-baked slope sprinkled with willows,
we came to the conclusion that the “tunnel”
also was a pipe dream.</p>

<p>Cutting a willow club for myself, with the thought
that I might need it before the night was over, I
came back to the shore to find Poppy staring across
the wide stretch of water at the sandstone bluffs
that have been given earlier mention in my story.</p>

<p>“Quick, Jerry!” he beckoned.</p>

<p>What he had seen was a man in a rowboat, nothing
unusual in itself except that the boatman, who
was little more than a speck to us, disappeared into
one of the unfrequented canyons, sort of pushing
the boat along with a pole.</p>

<p>Poppy, of course, as could have been expected
of him under the circumstances, was now bound and
determined to cross the river. And remembering
about old Cap’n Tinkertop’s hidden rowboat, I led
the way to the sheltered mouth of Weir creek. But
the boat was gone! And then the truth of the situation
slowly percolated into my bean. It was the
Cap’n’s boat that we had seen across the river. The
one-armed man had stolen it, which explained why
the boat, as we had gotten a glimpse of it at a distance,
was being pushed along with a pole.</p>

<p>Poppy’s interest switched quickly from the cat
killer to the creek.</p>

<p>“Where does it go to?” says he, rubbering up stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
through the bushes that cluttered the banks.</p>

<p>“I never followed it,” I told him, “so I can’t tell
you.”</p>

<p>Using a willow pole as a measuring stick, he thus
learned that the water in the middle of the narrow
stream was up to his neck.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” he cried, jumping with excitement.</p>

<p>“What wonderful discovery have you made now?”
says I.</p>

<p>“Don’t you catch on, Jerry?” he laughed. “The
pirate used this creek as a sort of hidden harbor.
For he was too foxy, let me tell you, to have his
secret tunnel open directly on the river. So the
thing for us to do is to follow the creek until we
come to shallow water. And then, kid, don’t be
surprised if we <i>do</i> find an underground tunnel, after
all. Come on, Jerry!” and off he tore through the
thicket like a house afire.</p>

<p>The creek, as we followed it, keeping as close to
the banks as possible, wound here and there, as such
streams do. So far as we could determine the depth
in the middle was never less than two feet, which
was plenty deep enough for a flat-bottomed skiff.
There was no current, which showed that the
stream, in spite of its name, was really nothing
more than a bayou. Still, was my conclusion, it
probably had some kind of a feeder up ahead, if
nothing more than the occasional overflow of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
canal. There was a heavy growth of slough moss
here, but the channel was noticeably open, and we
fancied, as we pushed and pulled our way through
the dense willows, that we could see places here
and there where the one-armed man had jabbed his
pole into the moss.</p>

<p>Presently the leader gave a triumphant shout.</p>

<p>“Look, Jerry!” he parted the willows. “There’s
the old stone house.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, we had circled until now we were
not more than thirty or forty rods from the pirate’s
house, in a low strip commonly called the “Weir
jungle.” And were we ever excited! Oh, boy! As
the saying is, we were getting “warmer” every
minute.</p>

<p>It was no trick for us to pick out the exact spot
on the creek bank where the boatman had landed.
And so frequent had been his trips here during the
past month that a path, which led off to the right,
showed plainly. Following this path, with a sharp
lookout ahead, we soon came to what seemed to be
the mouth of an abandoned cement tunnel, similar
to dozens of other old tunnels that I had seen in and
around Tutter. I never had known, though, that
any early tunneling for cement rock, which underlies
the floor of the valley, had been done here.</p>

<p>“I wish we had a light,” said Poppy, rubbering
into the black hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Gosh!” I sort of held off. “Wouldn’t you be
afraid to go in there?”</p>

<p>“What’s the risk,” says he, “when we know that
the one-armed geezer is on the other side of the
river?”</p>

<p>It was our theory now that the treasure hunter,
living in one of the hidden caves across the river,
was resting there for a few hours. So I ran back to
the stone house for a flashlight, as eager as the
leader was to do the exploring act.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally nearly had a fit when she learned
what we were planning to do.</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” she begged, thinking, I guess, of
the fix that we would be in if the one-armed man
came back to the tunnel sooner than we expected.
“Ye may be killed.”</p>

<p>But I didn’t let her scare me.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about us,” I laughed. Then,
ready to go, I told her to listen for us through the
cellar walls. We’d give five quick taps, I said.</p>

<p>If you think that a cellar is a cool place, you
ought to wrap yourself in a hunk of mosquito netting
some blistering-hot July day and stroll around
in a cement tunnel. You’d soon lose your sweaty
feeling. It’s strange to me where the cold air comes
from. Still, I guess it’s much the same with coal
mines or any other kind of underground places.
For my part, though, I’ll take the good old sunshine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
even when the thermometer has its neck stretched
out full length.</p>

<p>The pirate’s tunnel, as we now called the underground
passageway, seemed cooler to me, once we
got into it, than the average old tunnel of its kind.
As we went deeper into the icy hole, where everything
beyond the reach of our flashlight was as black
as pitch, we not only stopped every few seconds to
listen, but we doused our light, thinking that if we
stood in the darkness we could better pick up another
moving light, either ahead of us or behind
us. But we heard nothing. Neither did we see
anything.</p>

<p>As you may never have been in a cement tunnel,
especially an old one, I’ll describe what this tunnel
was like. The floor, of course, like the walls and
the seven-foot roof, was of solid rock, perfectly
flat, but cluttered with countless fallen chunks. The
walls, about twelve feet apart, were sort of jagged,
showing the way nature had put the rock together
in layers. Oak posts, or “props,” as we call them,
held up the roof. Some of these timbers, as picked
up by our flashlight, looked pretty rotten to me.
And I wondered, sort of anxious-like, if they hadn’t
just about come to the end of their usefulness. At
one place a hunk that must have weighed hundreds
of tons had fallen out of the roof, leaving a gaping
black hole. I was glad when we had passed this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
dangerous spot. For I had the feeling that there
might be more stuff up there ready to do the tumbling-down
act. And not for one second did I want
any young cement-rock mountain to tumble down
on top of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>Here and there we saw traces of the old two-rail
track over which the early mule-drawn dump-cars
had carried the raw rock into the daylight, to be
later hauled away to the mill. Some of the ties
were so rotten that they went together under our
feet like a sponge. At one place we waded ankle
deep through a pool of icy water. Br-r-r-r! Deep
in the tunnel now, the walls on both sides of us were
wet and dripping. Cold drops came down from the
ceiling on my head. It made me think of spiders.
And I sure hate spiders.</p>

<p>Tunnel exploring such as this was new stuff to
Poppy, so, naturally, as it is his nature to want to
know all the “why’s” and “wherefore’s” of everything,
he had a hundred questions to ask me. I
told him what I knew about cement work, explaining
that the new mill in Tutter was fed by rock that
was “stripped” instead of “tunneled,” as the tunneling
process was considered out-of-date. In the
places where the stripping was done, called quarries,
the workmen frequently tapped artesian veins, and
that, I said, was how we came to have those dandy
swimming holes south of town, of which the “fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
quarry,” as you may recall, entered so prominently
into my book, JERRY TODD AND THE WALTZING
HEN.</p>

<p>But aside from the unusual features of the tunnel,
itself, we saw nothing of special interest. Certainly,
to our great disappointment, we saw no
“treasure” chests, or, for that matter, anything that
had a “pirate” look to it.</p>

<p>The tunnel ended in a chamber of good size, the
walls of which were unbroken except for the entrance.
Plainly this was as far as the early miners
had gone. Were we now under the old stone house?
We wondered. Certainly, was our conclusion, we
had been traveling in that general direction. But
we saw no break in the chamber roof, which, like
the narrower passageway, was supported by oak
props.</p>

<p>“Let’s yell,” says I. “Maybe if we’re as close to
the house as we think, Mrs. O’Mally will hear us.”</p>

<p>So we whooped it up at the top of our voices. The
sound was deafening to us. But we got no answer.</p>

<p>Going back to the mouth of the passageway, after
having spent an unsuccessful hour underground, we
found ourselves wondering if the river pirate had
helped to build this tunnel, or whether, after it had
been abandoned, he had just copped it for his own
use, upon learning, possibly, that it ran under his
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Glory be!” cried Mrs. O’Mally, when we showed
up safe and sound. So full of joy was she that she
even tried to hug us! But that was all right with
me. I don’t mind letting an old lady hug me.
“Sure, ’tis a burden that has been lifted off me mind
at sight of ye. An’ what luck had ye?”</p>

<p>“No luck at all,” says Poppy. Then he told her
about us yelling.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear us?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I was expectin’ to hear ye. An’ the continued
silence was what set me to worryin’.”</p>

<p>Somewhat to my surprise Mother and Dad drove
into the yard about five o’clock. The doctors had
operated on Mr. Weckler, they said, and the old
man was getting along all right, though he was still
out of his head.</p>

<p>“He seems to think that his daughter Clara is in
the next room,” says Mother. “And they say it’s
very pitiful to hear him begging her to come to
him.”</p>

<p>“Is his daughter dead?” says I, remembering how
sad the old man had acted that day in the orchard.</p>

<p>“The general opinion is that she is dead. For she
hasn’t been seen or heard of since the time when
she ran off to get married, more than twenty years
ago.”</p>

<p>The two women then got their heads together in
“pickle” talk. And learning that our car had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
here purposely to take home a bushel of cucumbers,
I lugged them out of the cellar.</p>

<p>Mother was running around with a cucumber
pickle in each hand.</p>

<p>“Oh!...” she took on, like she does when she
sees a new baby or an unusual crochet pattern.
“Aren’t they <i>per</i>-fectly delicious? Have you tried
them, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” I shrugged.</p>

<p>I told her then that Poppy and I were going to
stay all night on the cucumber farm. Mrs. O’Mally
wanted us to, I said. For she had been hearing
strange sounds. I caught Dad looking at me curiously.
He realized, of course, that my chum and
I were up to something. But he didn’t ask me
any questions, realizing, I guess, that I was looking
forward to the fun of surprising him.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally lugged out a swell supper for us.
And then we sat around until it got dark. The
air, after the day’s heat, was sort of stagnant. And
as though begging for a cooling shower a bullfrog
army lined up in chorus on the river bank. Then
the katydids got busy. <i>See-e-e</i>-saw! <i>See-e-e</i>-saw!
They seemed to be very busy “sawing” something.
I wondered what it was. Down near the mouth of
the creek an owl shook itself awake and went,
“Whoo-o-o-o! Whoo-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>“Lively stuff, huh?” laughed Poppy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>I didn’t say anything. But somehow I had the
shaky feeling, as I watched the moon come up, that
it was going to be plenty lively enough for us before
morning. A fellow very frequently gets a premonition
like that, or whatever you call it. You know
what I mean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>MIDNIGHT EXCITEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that it was dark, with the shadows banked
up around the old stone house like prowling black
monsters from the river, would the one-armed treasure
hunter come back through the tunnel to the
secret rooms to resume his work? We hoped so.
And it was to catch the first possible sound of the
mysterious worker that we now gathered in Mrs.
O’Mally’s front room with sharpened ears.</p>

<p>At first we had talked secretly of following the
treasure hunter into the tunnel. But on discussion
that plan had been dropped. For it was too much
like starting in at the alley fence to open the front
gate. What we needed, for quick work, was a direct
opening into the secret rooms. And what better
way for us to get started than to check up on the
hidden pounder? Getting his general location, we
could then do an effective trick with a pair of picks.
Even if we had to amputate a whole wall Mrs.
O’Mally wouldn’t object. For see how much there
was at stake! Maybe a million dollars in gold!
Gee! Over three hundred thousand dollars apiece!</p>

<p>With talk like this going on, you can imagine
how crazy we were to see the inside of these hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
rooms that the river pirate had so strangely built
under his stone house. What were they?—treasure
vaults? And would we find whole stacks of crammed
treasure chests? Probably not, came the more
sensible thought, for if the gold cucumbers were so
openly exposed as that the one-armed worker would
have skinned out with them long ago. But no doubt
there were old-time weapons of fearful history in
the hidden rooms: muskets with bell barrels, bloodstained
cutlasses, and dirks deeply knicked by
human bones. Even more weird, we might find a
skeleton or two. Wow! Could you imagine anything
more exciting to a boy than to open up a place
like that? And think of the later fun of searching
for the hidden treasure!</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally’s nervousness had now completely
gone away. For she saw, all right, that she was
perfectly safe in our hands. And I wish you could
have seen the joy in her wrinkled face when we told
her about the happy days that lay ahead of her, with
no cucumbers to worry about, oodles of jack in the
bank, and even old stiff-neck Pennykorn bowing to
her respectfully as she gasolined down the boulevard
in her ten-thousand-dollar Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>Our talk then turned to old Mr. Weckler. And
drawn into the conversation, the pickle woman told
us things about the Weckler family that not only
surprised us but sent our minds off on a new line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
of speculation. The daughter, it seems, had eloped
with a nephew of the old river pirate. Nathan
Weir, Mrs. O’Mally went into details, had carried
a bad reputation. That is why Mr. Weckler, with
proper pride in his family, had refused to accept
the man as his son-in-law. But the girl wasn’t to be
stopped. And now that so many years had passed
away since she last had been heard from, it was
generally concluded, as Mother had mentioned, that
the runaway was dead, after a probably unhappy
married life.</p>

<p>But here was the point that walloped Poppy and
I between the eyes: A relative of the Weir family
by marriage, Mr. Weckler had been struck down
by the same man who was now searching for the
pirate’s hidden treasure, though as yet seemingly
without success. Could it be, then came the exciting
thought, that some motive deeper than intended
common robbery had taken the one-armed treasure
hunter to the house of our “silent” partner? Or,
to express the same thought in another way, could
it be that old Mr. Weckler, through his unhappy
connection with the Weir family, was somehow
or other mixed up in the secret of the hidden treasure,
as it had been put away by his son-in-law’s
rascally uncle?</p>

<p>And how strange, too, was our further thought,
that we should be drawn into this “cucumber” mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
at the very time when we had turned our
attention to cucumber pickles. First had come the
“Pickle Parlor” idea, through which we had become
associated with Mr. Weckler. Then, for reasons
still unknown to us, but now under speculation, a
housebreaker, whom we had every reason to believe
was the one-armed treasure hunter, whose chief interest,
outside of cat strangling, was <i>gold cucumbers</i>,
had strangely strewn cucumber pickles all over
Poppy’s cellar floor. At the time we had vaguely
thought it was our “diamond” ad that had attracted
the peculiar lawbreaker to the house. But now we
wondered, with tangled minds, if, instead, the man
hadn’t marked us because of our associations with
Mr. Weckler, whose house, as you know, had later
been broken into. Then, in the “cucumber” chain,
had come the discovery of the gold cucumber in the
flower bed, followed quickly by the story of the
pirate’s cucumber mold. Including Mrs. O’Mally in
the tangle, whose specialty was cucumbers, it was
a befuddling “cucumbery” mess, to say the least.</p>

<p>The clock boomed away at intervals as it climbed
the hill to the midnight peak. Then, at a quarter
of twelve, just as Mrs. O’Mally was in the middle
of a story in which an old lady in Ireland, who in
drinking out of a pan of milk in the dark had swallowed
a frog, we heard the familiar tap! ... tap!
... tap!... Getting on our tiptoes we ran from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
wall to wall. Then, unable to locate the sound, we
ran down cellar, Poppy leading with the flashlight,
me next, then Mrs. O’Mally, then the big yellow
cat. Tap! ... tap! ... tap!... We went from
wall to wall. But to no success. For the sound
came through one wall as distinctly as through another.
The four walls, in fact, seemed to <i>carry</i> the
sound, like a charged telephone wire.</p>

<p>Out of luck, as I say, we went back upstairs. The
clock struck twelve. The ghost hour! I was peculiarly
uneasy for a moment or two. I always feel
that way at midnight. Then a sound came out of
the cellar that literally turned me into an icicle—a
sound so <i>hideous</i> and so <i>awful</i> that you, too, I
think, had you been in my shoes, would have been
completely scared out of your wits.</p>

<p>Poppy flashed by me.</p>

<p>“The cat!” he cried, and throwing open the cellar
door he tumbled pell-mell down the stairs. Again
that awful blood-curdling, choking, gasping cry cut
my ears. And then, as though the deadly machine
had completed its fearful work, the cellar was
plunged into silence.</p>

<p>Knowing that the cat killer had secretly entered
the cellar, to the death of her cat, Mrs. O’Mally fell
helplessly into a chair. Her lips moved. But so
great was her fright—I might say her <i>horrified</i>
fright—that she could make no sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>My own voice, as I called my chum’s name,
sounded faint and squeaky. “Poppy!” I called
again. Then, as my legs began to lose their icy
anchors, I managed to get to the head of the cellar
stairs. “<i>Poppy!</i>” I called a third time.</p>

<p>But much less than getting an answer, there
wasn’t a sound.</p>

<p>I haven’t a very clear recollection of what happened
in the next few minutes. I completely lost
my head, I guess. I thought I had the hand lamp,
but discovered, when I started down the cellar
stairs, that I had the goldfish globe. I got the
lamp then. And pretty soon I found myself at the
foot of the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>Poppy was gone! There wasn’t a sign of him!
That’s why the cellar was so deadly quiet. Wherever
the secret door was in these grim stone walls—and
no longer could it be doubted that there <i>was</i>
such a door—it was through this hidden opening
that the cat killer had dragged my captured chum.</p>

<p>I was crazy now. All I could think of was that
Poppy was in terrible danger. I ran around and
around the cellar, the lamp chimney rocking in its
metal socket. “Poppy!” I called again and again.
“<i>Poppy!</i>” But there was no answer.</p>

<p>It was during one of these merry-go-round trips
of mine that I discovered the cat’s tail. A piece
about two inches long, it lay beside the huge chimney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
base in the center of the cellar. I gingerly
picked it up—meaning the tail end and not the
chimney base. There was fresh blood on it, proving
that it had just been cut off. Ough! I wanted
to drop it. But I felt I ought to keep it. I felt
I ought to tell poor Mrs. O’Mally about the terrible
crime. So, with the lamp in one hand, and the
sticky tail in the other, I zigzagged up the stairs
on high gear.</p>

<p>“It’s all that’s left of your cat!” I screeched,
waving the tail at its horrified owner.</p>

<p>“No, no!” came the shriek, when I put the tail
on the center table.</p>

<p>“But what’ll I do with it?” I cried.</p>

<p>“Throw the nasty thing outside.”</p>

<p>Well, I finally got some of my wits back. And I
saw that the only way to help my chum was to lay
for his captor at the mouth of the tunnel. So I
grabbed my willow club. Then I lit out. A thing
that helped me was the moonlight. Finally I came
to the creek. There was the boat pulled up on the
shore! I knew now that the man was still in the
tunnel. So I ran along the path. And pretty soon
I came to that awful black hole in the ground.</p>

<p>I listened. But I couldn’t listen very good for
my panting apparatus made too much noise. My
heart was pounding, too. Two, three, four minutes
passed. I wasn’t panting so hard now. But however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
much I stretched my ears I could hear no
sound of footsteps or distant underground voices.
Suddenly, though, I did catch the sound of something
behind me. Boy, did I ever jump! Coming
out of the willows was a black shape that crawled
along, animal-like, on its stomach. Or was it a
man on his hands and knees? Anyway, whatever
it was, animal or man, I knew that its burning
eyes were fastened on <i>me</i>. This was more than I
could stand. And screeching bloody murder I lit
out on the tear for the stone house. Scooting along,
I expected every minute to feel the awful thing grab
my heels. But I got away from it.</p>

<p>Tumbling into the house, who should I see, first
of all, to my great joy and amazement, but Poppy!
Yes, sir, not an apparition, or whatever you call it,
but old Poppy, himself, with his hair all mussed up
and his shirt-tail hanging out. He and Mrs. O’Mally
were bending over the couch. And when I got
closer I saw that they were working on a boy.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” I gasped, everything else going
out of my mind.</p>

<p>“Unconscious,” says Poppy, bathing the boy’s
forehead with a wet towel. Then he looked up.
“Ever see him before, Jerry?”</p>

<p>It was a boy about our age. With his closed eyes
and white face it was hard, of course, to tell exactly
what he looked like. But there was nothing about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
him that seemed familiar to me. Certainly, was my
conclusion, he wasn’t a kid from my own neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Uncle Abner!” the boy whispered, with a sort
of convulsive movement of his arms. “Uncle
Abner!”</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” Poppy asked me again.</p>

<p>“No,” I shook my head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE MAN IN THE CAVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> completely forgotten about the supposedly
strangled cat, you can imagine how my eyes
popped out when the bobtailed mouse catcher unexpectedly
meandered into the sitting room.</p>

<p>“Meow!” it broadcasted unhappily.</p>

<p>“An’ it had such a pretty tail, too,” sighed Mrs.
O’Mally.</p>

<p>I was still staring.</p>

<p>“But how did it escape the cat killer?” I cried.
And then, as my mind took in a wider and more
important sweep, I inquired of my chum how he
had escaped the cat killer, too.</p>

<p>“Our ‘cat killer,’ Jerry, instead of being a one-armed
man, has turned out to be a boy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Him?</i>” I switched my staring eyes from the cat
to the unconscious form on the couch.</p>

<p>Nodding, the leader then told me what had happened
in the cellar.</p>

<p>“As you remember, I ran down the stairs with a
flashlight, determined to get a squint at the cat
killer this time before he could make his usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
slick get-away. But the cellar was empty. The
cat, though, was still yowling bloody murder. I
tried to spot it, thinking now, from the choked
sound, that a tub or box had fallen on top of it.
But it, too, was gone. Finally, though, I traced it
to the chimney base. You know how big the chimney
base is. Right in the middle of the cellar floor,
too. The cat was inside! And there on the floor
was a piece of its tail! Instead of being solid brick,
as we had supposed, I saw now that one whole side
of the chimney base was made of sheet iron, painted
to look like brickwork, and hung on hidden hinges.
The quick closing of this secret door had trapped
the snooping cat, not only catching it by the tail but
completely cutting off the tip. The door, of course,
hadn’t opened and closed of its own accord. Hardly!
And afraid that if I waited for you it might be
locked on the inside, I gave the chimney corner a
sharp tug, figuring that this was the edge of the
secret door, and, sure enough, the whole west side
of the chimney swung back as pretty as you please.
This, of course, freed the cat, though not until it
had lost the tip of its tail, as I say. Turning the
flashlight into the chimney passage I saw the cat
scooting down a flight of winding stairs. I went
down the stairs, too, the door closing behind me.
I was in a sort of well. Then I came to a room at
the foot of the stairs. My flashlight picked up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
boy. I had expected to see a man! Lighting into
him, we both dropped our flashlights. And for two
or three minutes we tussled in the dark. What I
aimed to do, of course, was to make a prisoner of
him. I guess I soaked him pretty hard. Anyway,
he took a back flop. When I saw that he had struck
his head on the stone floor, and was unconscious, I
lugged him up the winding stairs, and here he is.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally brushed back the long black hair
from the white forehead.</p>

<p>“A nice-lookin’ b’y, too,” says she, in her
motherly way. “Sure, ’tis hard for me to think ill
of him.”</p>

<p>I told them then that they were dead wrong in
calling the stranger boy the cat killer.</p>

<p>“It was the cat killer,” I wound up, “that I saw
in the willow patch.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally was shivering over my story.</p>

<p>“How awful!” she cried. “’Tis little wonder that
ye were scared out of your wits.”</p>

<p>“I thought at first that it was an animal, crawling
along on its stomach. But now I’m sure that it
was a man. And who more likely than the cat killer,
himself?”</p>

<p>“Ough!” further shivered Mrs. O’Mally. “Quit
talkin’ about it. Sure, ye give me the creeps.”</p>

<p>Coming to his senses, the kid seemed to be none
the worse for his mishap. I saw now that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
big black eyes. Nor were they sneaking eyes,
either. Of course, after what had happened at the
foot of the hidden stairs he showed no love for
Poppy. But that was perfectly natural. If I had
been banged around the way he had I would have
been sore, too. But however much he glared at my
chum, he showed no hatred for me. Instead, I
caught him looking at me curiously.</p>

<p>Having failed to get a single word out of the
stranger, Poppy drew me into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen worse looking kids,” says I.</p>

<p>“What gets me,” came thoughtfully, “is his connection
with the cat killer. The man must be a
crook, for otherwise he wouldn’t be breaking into
people’s houses. But I can’t make myself believe
that the boy is a crook.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with him?” says I.
“Keep him prisoner until we find the treasure?”</p>

<p>“We never could hold him, Jerry.”</p>

<p>I saw what the leader meant. If we made a prisoner
of the kid the one-armed man, on his side,
would clean up on us in a jiffy. In fact, it was
hardly to be doubted that the cat killer already had
his eyes on us in evil plans.</p>

<p>“Let’s lock the doors,” I shivered.</p>

<p>I was crazy, of course, to see the hidden passageway
that the leader had discovered in the chimney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
base. But my increased fear of the one-armed cat
killer was stronger than my curiosity. <i>Me</i> go down
in that hole and run the chance of getting necked,
like the church cat? No, thanks! I had had one
narrow escape at the tunnel mouth. And that was
enough for me.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally told us afterwards that the kid
watched the kitchen door like a hawk all the time
we were out of his sight. For he knew, of course,
that we were talking about him, and that seemed
to worry him. But though we tried again to find
out who he was, not a single word would he tell us
about himself.</p>

<p>Poppy finally came to a plan.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” he drew me aside, “do you know
where we can get a rowboat?”</p>

<p>“The kid’s boat is in the creek,” says I.</p>

<p>“No,” he shook his head, “we’ve got to have
another boat.”</p>

<p>Getting the details of his scheme, I took a grip
on my club and started out in the direction of the
river bridge, two miles away, where old Deacon
Pillpopper, who helped us solve the mystery of the
ten-ring puzzle, as mentioned in my book, JERRY
TODD AND THE TALKING FROG, runs a boat
livery.</p>

<p>The moonlight was almost as bright as day. So
by keeping away from the bushes and other sheltering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
things I felt pretty safe. Coming to the
road, I lit out on the run, feeling that with every
flying step I was leaving the shadowy, crawling
thing farther behind me. Strangely, though, even
when I was a mile from the house, I had the uncomfortable
feeling that I was being watched. And
from later developments I cannot doubt that I <i>was</i>
watched.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock when I got the surprised and
sleepy-eyed boat renter out of bed. Dickering with
him for a minute or two, I then set off downstream.
Boy, did I ever row! As I look back the wonder
to me is that I didn’t snap an oar. Coming within
sight of the pirate’s house, with its outstanding
chimney, I pulled close to the shore. Then I gave
one long “hoot” and three short ones, signifying
“thirteen,” which was the signal that Poppy and I
had agreed upon.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed. Then I got the expected
answering signal—“<i>Hoo-o-o-t! Hoot! hoot! hoot!</i>”—after
which the “owl,” himself, soon came into
sight.</p>

<p>“The trick worked as slick as a button, Jerry,”
he laughed. “As soon as I got your signal I started
to snore. The prisoner, of course, thought that I
had dropped asleep. And quick as scat he stepped
over my body, as I lay in front of his bedroom door,
and skinned out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The leader then asked me if I had seen anything
of the cat killer on my way to the bridge. I hadn’t,
I said. Nor had he seen or heard anything of the
man at the stone house, he then told me.</p>

<p>Piling into the boat we rowed for dear life, as it
was our further scheme to beat the kid and his uncle
across the river. In going to their cave they’d never
suspect that we were following them, and so, by
secretly listening in on their gab, we could get a
good line on them.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says Poppy, as the other boat came
out of the creek into the moonlit river. Flipping
the oars harder than ever, we soon turned into the
opposite canyon, where we waited in a dark water
cave.</p>

<p>Dip! Dip! Dip! We could hear the other oars
now. Then the boat came into sight.</p>

<p>“What the dickens?...” breathed Poppy,
clutching my hand. “The kid’s alone!”</p>

<p>In letting the prisoner escape, as a part of our
scheme, we hadn’t dreamed for an instant but what
he and his rascally uncle would get together at the
creek and quickly light out for home in their boat.
We wondered now why the man had stayed behind.
And we were uneasy, too, over Mrs. O’Mally. Letting
the other boat pass us, we guardedly took in
after it, keeping in the shadow of the towering
wooded cliffs, now wrapped in a peculiar abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
silence. The water didn’t extend into the
canyon very far, and presently we saw the kid land
and scoot off into the trees, quickly passing from
our sight. But fortunately I knew where the principal
caves were. And it was our good luck to find
a light in the first one that we came to.</p>

<p>Getting down on our stomachs we crawled like
snakes from bush to bush. But it was a lucky thing
for us that we didn’t get too close to the enemy’s
hiding place. For all of a sudden the kid, himself,
tumbled out of the cave and threw himself face
downward in the bushes.</p>

<p>Within the cave a talking machine had come to
life. I don’t know what the tune was. I suspect,
though, that it was a very old one. As a matter of
fact, like Poppy, I was too amazed at the moment
to pay any attention to tunes. The big thing in our
minds was <i>why</i> the kid had turned on the talking
machine in the first place, and <i>why</i> he was now
hiding in the bushes.</p>

<p>We soon found out.</p>

<p>“Um....” came a sleepy yawn from within the
cave. And at the unexpected sound Poppy caught
his breath. I could imagine that he was doing some
quick thinking. “Who in tunket turned that dum
thing on?” a deep voice growled. “Tommy Weir!
Did you do that?”</p>

<p>But the kid, if that was his name, didn’t answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“<i>Tommy Weir!</i>” the voice was raised.</p>

<p>Still no answer from the kid.</p>

<p>“Drat that boy! Ought to have his setter
warmed up good an’ proper. TOMMY WEIR!
Air you goin’ to shet that thing off? Or will I have
to git up an’ take my cane to you?”</p>

<p>The kid still keeping silent, we heard the angry
caveman get out of bed. Then a record that had
been jerked from the silenced talking machine
whizzed over the top of our heads.</p>

<p>Thump! thump! thump! A lame old man now
stood, cane in hand, in the door of the cave. He
had on a long white nightgown, and never in all my
life had I seen another such bristly, mussed-up head
of hair. He had whiskers, too—the “fringy” kind,
stretching from ear to ear, with the chin and upper
lip left bare. And what a grim, hard lip it was!
Looking at him, as he stood there in the moonlight,
I could imagine that the kid was in for a good
beating.</p>

<p>“Tommy Weir! You git in here, now. Or
I’ll come out there an’ lay it on you good an’
proper.”</p>

<p>To our surprise the kid got up laughing.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Uncle Abner?”</p>

<p>“You young scallawag! Gittin’ your pore ol’
uncle out of his comfortable bed at this time of
night. Hain’t you ’shamed of yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“I wanted to tell you something, Uncle Abner,”
says the kid seriously.</p>

<p>“Um.... You could ’a’ let it wait till mornin’.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tommy!</i>” cried the old man in sudden excitement.
“You hain’t meanin’ that you’ve <i>found</i> it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came in disappointment, “what was it
then?”</p>

<p>The two went into the cave out of sight.</p>

<p>“They caught me to-night, Uncle Abner.”</p>

<p>“They? Who do you mean?—the Irish lady?”</p>

<p>“No. Two boys. One of them knocked me
cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” came severely. “It’s what you git,
Tommy Weir, for gallivantin’ ’round on Sunday
night, breakin’ the Sabbath, when you should ’a’ bin
home studyin’ your Bible lesson. Yes, you should!
Jest because we’re livin’ here in a cave is no reason
why you shouldn’t go on with your Bible work.
Them old lessons I’ve got saved up is jest as good
as any new ones, fur the Bible is jest the same to-day
as it was a hundred years ago. I ought to take
a stick to you fur not mindin’ me.... Where did
they catch you?”</p>

<p>“In the room under the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Two boys, you say?”</p>

<p>“They’re staying there, I guess. They called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
each other Poppy and Jerry. Jerry’s all right. But
if I ever get a crack at that other simp! Gr-r-r-r!”</p>

<p>“Tutter boys, prob’ly.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Oh, gee! I guess it isn’t any use,
Uncle Abner,” and I was struck by the weary, discouraged
tone of the boy’s voice. “I’ve searched
and searched. But I don’t seem able to find a thing.
And now I wouldn’t dare to go back if I wanted to.
For the boys know about the secret door in the
chimney. And they’d lay for me.”</p>

<p>“Um.... I’m all out of patience with you,
Tommy Weir.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t scold, Uncle Abner.”</p>

<p>“You need to have a good stick laid on you, you
do.”</p>

<p>I was beginning to see that the old man’s threats,
like his fierce expression, didn’t amount to much.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a cat killer, Uncle Abner?”</p>

<p>“A which?”</p>

<p>“A cat killer—a man who strangles cats. The
boys asked me about it over and over, as though
they thought <i>I</i> ought to know what they were talking
about. And one of them says he <i>saw something</i>
at the mouth of the tunnel. You know what I told
you!”</p>

<p>“Tommy! Did he say it was <i>creepin’</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“An’ <i>you</i> say it was creepin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Yes. I saw it in exactly the same place, too.”</p>

<p>“Um.... Did the boys finally turn you loose?”</p>

<p>“No. I got away from them.”</p>

<p>“Heh?” the voice struck a sharper pitch. “What’s
that?”</p>

<p>The kid recited the story of his escape.</p>

<p>“Tommy,” the old man snorted, “you’re dumb.
Yes, you be, an’ you needn’t look so indignant about
it, nuther. You’re a good boy in some ways, but
you don’t make enough use of your head.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, them boys let you git away on purpose.
The one you call Poppy wasn’t asleep at all. He
was jest foxin’. Where was the other one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Outside, prob’ly. An’ you never suspected that
they was followin’ you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Poppy chuckled in my ear.</p>

<p>“Uncle Abner isn’t so dumb, huh?”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” I hissed. “There he is.”</p>

<p>Having again come to the door of the cave, the
old man took a sweeping look here and there, as
though studying the general lay of things, then
pointed his cane directly at our hiding place.</p>

<p>“If they’re here,” says he sharply, “they’re hidin’
behind that bush. Fur it’s the biggest an’ nearest
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Gee! Caught by surprise we had no chance to
dig out.</p>

<p>“Um ...” old whiskers grunted savagely, as we
stood up. “I thought as much. Now, jest march in
here, you young scallawags, an’ give an account of
yourselves.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>UNCLE ABNER’S STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Full</span> of curious admiration for the keen-eyed old
man who had thus exposed us so cleverly and unexpectedly,
Poppy and I filed sheepishly into the
cave.</p>

<p>About fourteen feet in depth, the roomy chamber
was furnished with a rustic table, over which hung
a lantern, two chairs, and, on opposite sides, well
back, two floor beds, the mattresses of which had
been made of plaited grass. There was a stand, too,
supporting a huge Bible, such as preachers use, and
on a lower shelf of the stand was the talking machine
that we had heard. Later we learned that the
kid had made the furniture with a hatchet and
scout knife, which shows you what a clever little
woodsman <i>he</i> is.</p>

<p>The talk between the boy and his uncle had made
it plain to us that much less than being in cahoots
with the cat killer they really knew nothing about
the other man, except that the boy had “seen something”
at the mouth of the tunnel. This made the
cat killer more of a mystery to us than ever. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
there was added mystery, too, in these other people.
But who could be afraid of an old man, however
stern he tried to be, whose chief interest seemed
to be in Bibles and Sunday-school lessons! Certainly,
Poppy and I weren’t afraid. Our principal
feeling, as I say, was curiosity.</p>

<p>The old man continued to glare at us.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he demanded of the leader,
in a gruff voice.</p>

<p>“Poppy Ott.”</p>

<p>The questioner then turned as savagely to me.</p>

<p>“Jerry Todd,” says I.</p>

<p>The scowl deepened.</p>

<p>“Which one of you hit my Tommy?”</p>

<p>The sight of us had sort of stupefied the kid. But
now his eyes blazed up.</p>

<p>“It was him,” he properly pointed.</p>

<p>“I took you for an enemy,” Poppy explained his
attack.</p>

<p>“For two cents,” cried the kid, “I’d ‘enemy’ you
with a crack on the jaw.”</p>

<p>“Tommy!” came the sharp command. “You shet
up an’ keep still.”</p>

<p>“I can lick him,” the kid glowered.</p>

<p>“I’ll do some ‘lickin’ in a minute or two if you
don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>The old man’s pretended fierceness was funny to
us. More than that, with his whiskers and everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
he looked funny. So it isn’t surprising that
Poppy grinned. And as though this was the final
straw that tipped the hay cart over, or whatever the
old saying is, the kid lit into the hated one like a
young hurricane. For a minute or two all I could
see was flying arms and legs. Over and over they
rolled, whanging and banging each other like a
couple of prize fighters. And, bu-lieve me, old
Poppy had all he could handle! In the fracas the
table was tipped over. Tin dishes clattered right
and left. The old man tried to separate the fighters
with his cane. Whack! whack! whack! But they
paid no attention to the sharp cracks that he gave
them. So he grimly got the pepper shaker. No kid
can scrap and sneeze at the same time. So, for the
present, at least, the battle was ended.</p>

<p>Nor were the two tousled fighters the only ones
who dizzily contributed to the sneezing act. Boy, I
thought I’d rip a hole in the top of my beezer.
Uncle Abner spit his false teeth clean across the
cave. Even the Bible stand rocked. But finally
things sort of quieted down.</p>

<p>“Sech carryin’ on fur Sunday night,” stormed the
old man, upon the recovery of his teeth. “I’m
ashamed of you, Tommy Weir. Yes, I be. This
other boy wasn’t wantin’ to fight. You’re the one
who started it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to knock his block off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“That’s enough from you, young man,” came in
thundering tones. “You go right over there an’ set
down on that bed. An’ if you give me any more
trouble I’m a-goin’ to lay you across my knee.”</p>

<p>“Aw!...” says Poppy, sort of buttoning himself
together after the fracas. “He’s all right. Let
him be.”</p>

<p>The old man then went at us with a bunch of
questions. He was shrewd about it, too.</p>

<p>“I kin see,” he nodded in conclusion, “that you
boys know a great deal more about the secrets of
the old stone house than you’re willin’ to admit.
An’ now that you’ve followed Tommy here, I kin
imagine that you’re curious to know who we be.
To that p’int, to encourage frankness on your side,
too, I don’t mind tellin’ you that my name is Abner
Weir, more commonly known in Rimtown, Ohio,
where our home is, as ‘Uncle Ab.’ Fortune has
made me a nepher of the old rascal who built that
house across the river. Asa Weir an’ Severn Weir,
my father, was brothers, Asa bein’ much the oldest.
Tommy, here, my nepher, is the only child of my
brother. His ma an’ pa are dead. They’s jest me
an’ him left in the family.”</p>

<p>Pausing, the speaker then regarded us intently
for a moment or two. He seemed to be studying us.
He realized, of course, that we were treasure hunting
on our own hook. We hadn’t admitted it; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
he knew! And being in the game, too, I could
imagine that he was sort of figuring how he could
draw us out without saying too much himself.</p>

<p>“Now, if me an’ Tommy was desperate characters,”
he went on steadily, “we could easy enough
rope you up an’ keep you here, seein’ as how you’re
workin’ ag’in’ us. We probably could make you tell
things, too, to our interests. But, frankly, we hain’t
people of that sort. Tommy, of course, is kind of
hot-headed, as you jest saw. But that hain’t nothin’
ag’in’ him to speak of. I used to be hot-headed
myself when I was his age. An’ even to-day if I’m
woke up sudden I start pitchin’ things. The other
mornin’ I pitched a fryin’ pan. Jest missed Tommy’s
head, too. So that is why he woke me up to-night
with the talkin’ machine. The one big p’int
is, as I see it, air we goin’ to turn you loose, to further
work ag’in’ us, or, in fairness to us, would you
first like to hear our story to sort of decide in your
own minds whether or not it might not be best for
you to work with us?”</p>

<p>Poppy’s face was curious.</p>

<p>“Why do you put it that way?” says he guardedly.
“Do you <i>want</i> us to work with you?”</p>

<p>“No!” the kid shoved in.</p>

<p>“Shet up, you!”</p>

<p>“Aw, heck! Throw the big simp out.”</p>

<p>But Poppy only grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Did you ever hear of a man by the name of
Nathan Weir?” he then inquired, thinking, I guess,
that here was a good chance to find out something
about Mr. Weckler’s missing daughter.</p>

<p>The old man seemed suddenly saddened by the
question.</p>

<p>“Nathan an’ me was brothers,” says he in a lower
voice. “Tommy is his son.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Poppy, staring. Then he shot a
glance at me.</p>

<p>“Tommy had a good ma,” the old man went on.
“But his pa, if I must say so as an own brother, was
a bad one. So it’s jest as well, I s’pose, everything
considered, that he’s dead. Fur them kind of people
only make the world unhappier.”</p>

<p>Poppy turned curiously to the kid.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” says he, “that your grandfather
lives in Tutter?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” came the scowl. “I’m not interested in
<i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“He’s a nice old man.”</p>

<p>“That’s what <i>you</i> say.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen him?”</p>

<p>“No, nor I don’t ever care to.”</p>

<p>“Why do you hate him?” says Poppy curiously.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I hate him,” the kid’s eyes
blazed, “after the way he turned down my mother.”</p>

<p>“He never knew what became of your mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Like time he didn’t! She wrote to him when she
was down and out, asking him to take me. And he
never as much as answered her letter. So, do you
think I’m going to chase after him now? I guess
not! I wouldn’t have come this close to him if it
hadn’t been for the hidden treasure.”</p>

<p>Poppy then told how the grandfather had been
hit on the head.</p>

<p>“A one-armed burglar,” spoke up the old man,
sort of reflective-like. “It ought to be easy to spot
him.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a one-armed man hanging
around here?”</p>

<p>“No, nor a two-armed man, nuther.”</p>

<p>“And you never suspected that you were being
secretly watched?”</p>

<p>“Only what Tommy told me about seein’ somethin’
near the tunnel. But he wasn’t sure whether
it was a man or not.”</p>

<p>“I have a hunch,” waggled Poppy, “that the cat
killer, as we call him, for want of a better name, has
been keeping closer tab on you than either of you
suspect. And the object, of course, was to let you
lift the treasure and then grab it on you.”</p>

<p>“But who can it be?” puzzled the old man.</p>

<p>“If it’s some one who has followed you here,”
says Poppy, “you ought to be able to answer that a
whole lot better than us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Tommy,” the old man turned to his nephew,
“kin you remember any one-armed men ’round
Rimtown?”</p>

<p>“No,” the kid slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Um.... This cat killer, evidently, is a bad
egg. An’ as they’s safety in numbers, I’m more convinced
than ever that the four of us ought to be
workin’ together. Besides, we prob’ly kin do
quicker work if we put together what <i>we</i> know an’
what <i>you</i> know. Bein’ relations, me an’ Tommy,
of course, has first claim on the gold. You kain’t
git around that. An’ if you were to git it ahead of
us we prob’ly could go to law an’ take it away from
you. I’m not sayin’ that, however, to force you to
j’ine us. You kin do whatever you think is best.
But it would be an awful unlucky day fur both
parties, I’m here to tell you, if we was to monkey
along separately, each sort of buckin’ the other,
an’ let the cat killer lift the treasure ahead of us.
So, if you’ll j’ine us we’ll agree to go fifty-fifty with
you, me an’ Tommy gittin’ half an’ you fellers the
other half.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve already promised to share the treasure
with Mrs. O’Mally,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“The old lady in the stone house?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Um.... After the scare we’ve given her with
our ‘ghost’ noises she’s entitled to a share of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
treasure, I guess. Anyway, she holds a deed to the
land. That’s somethin’ in her favor. So, if you’re
willin’, we’ll split the treasure five ways. Yes or
no?”</p>

<p>Poppy looked at me.</p>

<p>“I’m willing, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Here, too,” says I.</p>

<p>“Very well,” nodded the pleased old man. “But
to make it a good bargain I guess you’d better go
over there an’ shake hands with Tommy. I see he’s
bin sittin’ there chawin’ his finger nails, which is a
purty good sign that he’s sorry fur havin’ let his
temper git away from him. An’ if you’ll give him a
chance to show his real nature I think you’ll find
that he’s a purty nice boy.”</p>

<p>As the old man had said, the kid didn’t look so
mad now. Still, it kind of surprised me when he
shoved out his mitt to us. And what a firm, warm
mitt it was! Here was a kid, I told myself, whose
friendship was worth prizing.</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy,” the old man grinned at his
nephew, who now sat between us on the bed, “who’s
goin’ to do the talkin’, me or you?”</p>

<p>“You go ahead, Uncle Abner.”</p>

<p>A chair was brought forward.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how much you boys know about
this rascally uncle of mine who put away the treasure
on the other side of the river,” the story was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
begun, “but if all accounts of him is true I tremble
to think of what become of his wicked soul when
he died. His thievery, though, as it was told to me,
was a slim business fur the most part, as he hadn’t
much chance to get his hands on anything big. One
day, though, the story got out that a St. Louis
packet was comin’ up the river with a shipment of
gold. Well, old Peg-leg, as I’ll call him, seein’ as
how that’s what everybody else called him, was
determined to make the one big haul of his wicked
career. An’, as we know, he did it. They was
murder on the river that terrible night. An’ the
gold that was later put away has on it the taint of
human blood. A few weeks later, in early winter,
old Peg-leg was shot. An’ when he was dyin’ he
give my father, who was then a boy in knee pants,
a gold cucumber about as long as my thumb. ‘It’s
the key,’ says he. ‘Keep it. An’ whatever you
find is yours.’ Then the posse broke in an’ my
father had to git out of sight into the tunnel or he,
too, young as he was, would ’a’ bin lugged off to
jail an’ mebbe hung. Skippin’ the country, he went
to Ohio, settlin’ near Rimtown, an’ so ’fraid was
he of the Illinois law that he never dared to go
back.</p>

<p>“This, of course, happened many years ago. An’
havin’ bin born an’ brought up in another state I
never knew that they was sech a man as old Peg-leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Weir until my brother Nathan picked up the story
from a distant relative. He come here then, Nathan
did, to see what he could find, though he hadn’t bin
told about the gold cucumber, as none of us knew
about that until our father’s death. What Nathan
brought home, a year later, wasn’t a chest of gold
but a wife. Jest a young girl. Then, several years
later, Tommy was born. As he grew up he was a
great pet of his grandpa’s, an’ we used to wonder
what the old man meant when he kept sayin’, ‘Some
day, Tommy, Grandpa’s goin’ to make you rich.’
We was dirt poor. An’, fur one, I couldn’t figure
out where these sudden riches was comin’ from.
Then, on the tenth of last May,” the voice dropped,
“we was left entirely alone, me an’ Tommy, but
not until we had bin told the story of the gold cucumber.
It was given to Tommy on his grandpa’s
deathbed, an’ we was told about the tunnel an’ the
secret door in the chimney. So, naturally, as soon
as we could straighten up our affairs we set out fur
Illinois, each with a pack on his back, an’ here we
be with all of our belongings, which hain’t much.
Of course, in startin’ out we hadn’t any idear of
endin’ up in a cave like this. Havin’ bin led to
believe that the old house was deserted, we expected
to use it temporarily. But on findin’ it occupied we
did the next best thing. An’, to that p’int, we’ve bin
comfortable here, though sometimes the spiders an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
skeeters git after us. Makin’ free use of a boat that
we found tied in the creek, we first went back an’
forth across the river in the dark. It wasn’t any trick
fur us to find the tunnel an’ later on the secret passage
leadin’ to the underground cellar. But however
much we sounded the stone walls in the underground
room we could find no hollow places, as seemed
natural to expect. Lately I’ve quit goin’ over. Fur
it seemed useless to me. But Tommy he hung on.
He even took to goin’ over in broad daylight. But
still, after a month’s work, we’re right where we
started in. So, however good our claim is to the
treasure, we’ll be mighty glad to share it with you,
as I say, if you kin help us find it. Fur we’ve had
no luck ourselves.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I were dead sure, of course, as we enthusiastically
told the old man, that the treasure
would soon be separated from its hiding place. And
now that we were all working together, including
Mrs. O’Mally, why not abandon the cave, we suggested.
There was plenty of room for all of us in
the big stone house. And the others would be a lot
safer over there than here. So the cave stuff was
quickly gathered up. And then, as we were leaving,
the old man, now dressed, got down on his
knees to dig his money box out of a hole in the
floor.</p>

<p>“We hid it,” he explained, “not so much because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of the hundred dollars that we’ve got in it as on
account of the gold cucumber. Wait jest a minute
an’ I’ll show it to you. Mebbe you kin better figure
out its secret than us.”</p>

<p>There was a startled cry.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!”</p>

<p>Poppy and I saw in a flash what had happened.
Secretly watching the cave, as the leader had said,
the cat killer had stolen the gold cucumber, only to
lose it later on in Mr. Weckler’s flower bed.</p>

<p>“I—I guess, boys,” the old man got up, white-faced,
“that we’re done fur now.”</p>

<p>Poppy laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think so, Mr. Weir. For it so
happens that Jerry and I have been claiming ownership
to your gold cucumber for the past twenty-four
hours.” Hurriedly he told how the cucumber had
fallen into our hands. “You can see,” he concluded,
“why we connected the cat killer with the treasure.
For that same morning we found out that the pirate
not only had raised cucumbers as a hobby, but had
made a queer cucumber mold.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes were full of admiration.</p>

<p>“Smart!” he waggled. “Smart as a whip!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later our two loaded boats were
afloat on the river. And as I looked back at the
shore, with the talking machine in my lap, I fancied
that I could trace the outline of a creeping black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
shape. But I wasn’t scared. For there were four
of us now.</p>

<p>Oh, baby! The fun we were going to have! We
were poor now. But in a day or two we probably
would be as rich as Henry Ford.</p>

<small>POPPY’S PEDIGREED PICKLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Landing</span> on the north shore of the river, the
boats were dragged out of the water, to keep them
from wandering off into the current, after which we
jiggled the cave truck into four equal loads and
started single file for the darkened stone house,
where we did a snappy little rat-a-tat-tat on the
closed front door.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” Mrs. O’Mally’s quavering voice percolated
through the keyhole.</p>

<p>Getting our answer, the door was quickly thrown
open.</p>

<p>“We’ve brought you company,” laughed Poppy,
as the whole gang traipsed in.</p>

<p>The woman stared at the visitors, more particularly
at the stooped old man.</p>

<p>“Howdy, ma’am,” says he, taking off his hat and
bowing like a hand-organ monkey. Then his bundle
got away from him and tin pans galloped all over
the room.</p>

<p>“Mither of Moses!” hurdled Mrs. O’Mally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
“’Tis a wonder ye wouldn’t scare the wits out of a
body.”</p>

<p>We told her then who the old man was, and why
the kid was no longer a prisoner.</p>

<p>“As we’re all working together,” Poppy wound
up, “we figured that the safest and best plan,
with the cat killer in mind, was to live together,
too.”</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis welcome ye are to what I’ve got,” came
heartily from the generous woman. “An’ ’tis glad
I am, too, for your company. For with secret doors
in me cellar an’ a vicious prowler without, ’tis no
safe place for a lonely ould widdy. Look at me!
’Tis still tremblin’ I be from the fright that gripped
me when I heard ye on the front porch. For, thinks
I, ’tis no one but that creepin’ cat killer, himself—bad
luck to his murderin’ soul!”</p>

<p>“Has he been here again, Mrs. O’Mally?”</p>

<p>“Niver a sound have I heard from him since ye
left. But ’tis the constant feelin’ I’ve had that
there’s <i>eyes</i>.”</p>

<p>I knew what she meant. For it was those same
hidden <i>eyes</i> that had put the shivers in me on the
way to the bridge.</p>

<p>Having been up all night, Poppy and I were dead
tired, as you can imagine. But dizzy as I was from
lack of sleep, I had no intention of turning in until
I had seen the underground chamber. So, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Mrs. O’Mally and Uncle Abner to frisk the extra
beds into shape, the leader and I, with our new
chum, skinned down the cellar stairs. Then, having
opened the secret door—and I might explain here
that the only reason why the door had escaped us
in the first place was because the chimney base was
built squarely in the middle of the cellar floor—we
next corkscrewed down the winding stairs. As
Poppy had said, it was like going down a peculiar
well. Coming to the room where Tom had gotten
the “bump on the bean,” as he now grinningly expressed
it, I zigzagged here and there, hoping to
feast my eyes on some of that wonderful “pirate”
truck that we had talked of. But the only “weapons”
in sight were Tom’s pick and an old mule collar.
Nor were there any skeletons.</p>

<p>“What makes you so sure,” says Poppy, when we
had made the rounds, “that the treasure is walled
up in this room?”</p>

<p>“That’s what Grandpa Weir told us.”</p>

<p>“Did he see it put away?”</p>

<p>“No. But he said we’d find it here.”</p>

<p>Poppy swung the pick.</p>

<p>“Solid rock,” says he.</p>

<p>We were then taken through another secret passage
which connected the hidden room with the old
cement tunnel. Here we found a second iron door,
the complexion of which was so much like the solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
rock on either side of it that it had completely
escaped us. But, to that point, even if we had been
wise to the fact that it was there I doubt if we
could have spotted it.</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose built all these passages,”
puzzled Poppy. “The old pirate, himself?”</p>

<p>“If he did,” I put in, “he must have been some
worker.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa Weir didn’t tell us all the particulars,”
says Tom. “But it’s Uncle Abner’s opinion that
the early miners, whoever they were, tapped the
cellar of the stone house by accident. They couldn’t
have been skilled miners, Uncle Abner says, for a
shaft is never properly made from the bottom up.
Later the fake chimney base, with its secret door,
was built over the hole in the cellar floor. And as
this all favored my great-uncle’s crooked scheme,
it may be that the queer mining was done under his
orders.”</p>

<p>At four o’clock we hit the hay, Poppy and I sharing
one bed and Tom and his uncle the other. But
before turning in we double-locked the cellar door,
further rigging up a “tin-pan” burglar alarm. But
nothing woke us up.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally, as usual, had to pile out early to
start her pickers to work, but she moved quietly in
and out of the house, so the rest of us didn’t uncover
our eyes until ten o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Well,” says I, yawning, “what’s the program for
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Cucumbers,” says Poppy, reaching for his
pants.</p>

<p>“Gold?” I further exercised my jaws, as I thought
of our recent adventures.</p>

<p>“Gold and pickles, both.”</p>

<p>I suddenly sat up.</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night! With so much other truck going
on I’d completely forgotten about that bin of cucumbers.
What are we going to do with them?”</p>

<p>“We’ve either got to pickle them,” says Poppy,
“or sell them to old Pennykorn at a loss of a dollar
and ten cents a bushel.”</p>

<p>I put my adding machine to work.</p>

<p>“That’s almost eight hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“If the treasure turns out as well as we hope,”
says he, “the loss of eight hundred dollars might
not cripple us. But just the same I’d go ten miles
out of my way before I’d lose even a penny to that
grasping old geezer.”</p>

<p>“But, Poppy,” says I, getting a slant on his
thoughts, “how in the world are <i>we</i> going to pickle
seven hundred bushels of cucumbers? For even if
we had plenty of money to work with, we wouldn’t
know how to go about it.”</p>

<p>“We might hire old Butch,” he grinned, flipping
his necktie into shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Yes,” says I, matching his nonsense with some
of my own, “and we might commit suicide, too. But
who wants to do that when fried cakes are only ten
cents a yard?”</p>

<p>“Jerry, after eating those swell cucumber pickles
at his house—and I <i>know</i> they’re the same kind of
pickles that I bought at the food sale—it’ll forever
be a puzzle to me how he slopped over on the last
batch.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” says I uneasily, “that you aren’t thinking
of giving him a second trial.”</p>

<p>“Hardly.” Then he swatted me with a pillow.
“Get up, you lazy bum. Here I am all dressed and
you haven’t even untangled yourself from the
feather tick.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” I motioned him away. “I’ve
got an idea.”</p>

<p>“Spill it.”</p>

<p>“How would it be,” I suggested thoughtfully, “if
we got Mrs. O’Mally to do the pickle making for
us? Mother was raving about her pickles last night.
So they must be all right.”</p>

<p>“By George!” came the applause. “I wonder if
we can’t? Of course,” he added, with less enthusiasm,
“they won’t be the <i>wonder</i> pickles. We can’t
expect that. But other dealers sell big wads of
ordinary pickles. So, with fairly good luck, we
ought to be able to flag an order now and then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Shall we call her in and ask her?” says I eagerly,
feeling pretty hefty over the fact that little Y. T.
(meaning Yours Truly) had made the important
suggestion. Oh, I’m there, all right ... once or
twice a year, at least!</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” says Poppy. Then, having
slipped out of the room, I heard him stumble over
a chair in the empty kitchen. By hurrying, I was
well ornamented with clothes by the time he got
back. “Before saying anything to her,” he laughed,
“I thought we’d better sample her pickles on the
sly. For it’s a cinch we don’t want to make another
crazy blunder.” Then he shoved a cucumber at me.
“Try it,” says he, cheerfully, “and see what you
think of it.”</p>

<p>I loved that pickle about as much as you love
cod-liver oil.</p>

<p>“Oof!” I screwed up my nose. “Do I have to do
it?”</p>

<p>“Here we go,” says Poppy, heroically. “One, two,
<i>three</i>.”</p>

<p>At the third count I jabbed the hated pickle into
my mouth and began to chew. Then, as I got a
taste, I sort of stiffened with surprise, after which
I chewed all the faster, my jaws and eyes working
together.</p>

<p>“What the dickens?...” cried Poppy, staring
at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“It tastes to me like those church pickles,” says
I, staring back at him.</p>

<p>He was out of the room like a shot. And this
time, instead of grabbing a pickle apiece, he heaved
up the stairs to our boudoir with a whole dishful.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” he cried, when the bottom
of the dish was uncovered. “I can’t understand
it. But if these aren’t a match for the church
pickles and the ones I ate in old Butch’s house, I’ll
eat my shirt.”</p>

<p>I remembered then what the mule driver had
dished out to us about his choice recipe.</p>

<p>“Don’t you catch on?” I cried, as my beezer
slipped into high gear. “It was from Mrs. O’Mally
that old Butch got his recipe in the first place.”</p>

<p>Poppy looked dizzy.</p>

<p>“Were we ever dumb,” says he, “not to have
suspected it? And <i>him</i> going with her, too! Drill
a hole in my thick skull, Jerry: my brains need
ventilating.”</p>

<p>In answer to our questions, Mrs. O’Mally admitted
to us at the breakfast table that she had sent
some of her pickles to the food sale. She also had
given several jars, she said, to “a friend.” We
knew, of course, who the “friend” was! Feeling
that she was too poor to subscribe to the Tutter
newspaper, she thus had missed seeing our ad.</p>

<p>Starting in at the beginning, we handed her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
whole story, which amused her one minute and
amazed her the next. But when we asked her, in
the wind-up, to do the pickle-making stunt for us,
she almost fainted.</p>

<p>“<i>Me</i> pickle seven hundred bushels of cucumbers?
Mither of Moses! Is it the work of ten women that
ye think I can do?”</p>

<p>“All right,” Poppy quickly followed up. “We’ll go
at it that way, then. You’ll be the boss. See? And
the other women will do the work.”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. O’Mally,” old do-or-die hung on, “if
you don’t help us, we won’t be able to pay you for
the cucumbers. Besides, think of what it will mean
to you if the pickles turn out to be a big success.
We’ll be able to start up a pickle factory. That will
make you rich. For, of course, you’ll be one of the
owners.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” came dizzily, “’tis nothin’ I hear but talk
of riches. First it was the pirate’s treasure; an’
now it’s pickles.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” Poppy galloped along, “think how
lovely it will be to beat old Pennykorn at his own
game, who probably is waiting for you right now
with that ninety-cent contract.”</p>

<p>The pickle woman’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“He’ll get no ninety-cent cucumbers from me.”</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit, Mrs. O’Mally. We’ve got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
fight him. It’s our duty, sort of. For if we can
work this pickle scheme, independent of him, the
sweet-corn farmers can then get together, in pattern
of us, and beat him at that game, too. It will mean
thousands of dollars to them. And instead of mortgaging
their farms to buy shoes and stockings,
they’ll be able to ride around in Chevrolets.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally liked the idea of the Chevrolets.</p>

<p>“But what women have ye in mind?” she let down
the bars.</p>

<p>“Jerry’s ma will help, for one.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” I swung in. “And she probably can
get some of the Methodist ladies, too.”</p>

<p>Poppy almost jumped over the table.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” he yipped. “Now I know! There
isn’t a church in town that isn’t head over heels in
debt. All these bazaars that are put on by the different
church societies, and the chicken-pie suppers,
is just an endless run of schemes to raise money.
All right! If the church ladies want to raise money,
we’ll put them to work. We furnish everything and
they get ten per cent of what the pickles sell for.
Why, kid,” he yipped it off, from the peak of his
enthusiasm, “they’ll jump at a scheme like that.
Sure thing. And if we find out that we have more
cucumbers than the Methodist ladies can handle,
we’ll give the Presbyterian ladies a chance to lift
their church debt. If that isn’t enough, we’ll call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in the Catholic ladies. For pickles are pickles, kid,
regardless of whether they’re Protestant pickles or
Catholic pickles.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Mally got the idea from this talk that the
church ladies were going to run things to suit themselves.</p>

<p>“Sure,” she heaved a sigh of relief, “’tis glad I
am to learn that ye hain’t a-goin’ to need me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think for one minute that we aren’t
going to need you,” Poppy still held the floor. “In
fact,” he grinned, “you’re going to be the biggest
frog in the puddle. For everything that the women
do will be done under your directions. The point is,
Mrs. O’Mally, that we’ve got to turn out better than
average pickles if we’re going to put this scheme
across with a bang. You know how to do it. And
you’ll want to be on the job every minute, to make
sure that every part of the work is being done exactly
as you would do it if you were working alone.”</p>

<p>Leaving Tom and his uncle at work in the underground
room, with the promise that we’d give them
a helping hand as soon as we got our pickle business
better organized, Poppy and I lit out for town,
where we had an important talk with Mr. Thomas
Lorring, our former “stilt” partner, in the latter’s
private office in the Commercial Bank.</p>

<p>“What?” the president boomed at us in pretended
amazement, thinking, no doubt, of how we had similarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
called upon him for help in starting up our
stilt factory. “Are you young shavers trying to
organize another new industry?”</p>

<p>“A pickle factory,” grinned Poppy, who had a
hunch that he stacked up pretty high in the kindly
banker’s estimation.</p>

<p>“And you want to borrow money, heh?”</p>

<p>“All we can get.”</p>

<p>“Meaning how much?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars to start with.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Think you’re going to get it?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to,” says Poppy earnestly. “For if
we don’t our cucumbers will go to waste.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. Mrs. O’Mally can still sell
them to the canning company.”</p>

<p>It began to look as though we were going to get
turned down. And I could see that Poppy was
worried.</p>

<p>“But they’re trying to cheat her, Mr. Lorring,”
he burst out. “That’s one reason why we stepped
in. All they agree to pay her is ninety cents a
bushel.”</p>

<p>The banker held up a big red hand.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” says he, sort of quiet-like. “A
thing you want to learn, Poppy, if you’re going to
be a good business man, is not to go around telling
people that your competitor is a cheat. As a matter
of fact, Mr. Pennykorn isn’t a cheat. He’s just close-fisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
in his business dealings, that’s all. He isn’t
forcing any of the farmers to sell their stuff to him.
And the mere fact that his prices are low doesn’t
stamp his dealings as being crooked. I will say,
however, in justice to your viewpoint, that his way
of doing business isn’t right according to my notion.
And if we could clear up the situation for the local
farmers by starting another canning factory, I’d be
in favor of it. However, with all due respect to your
other manufacturing success, the organization of
such a factory isn’t a job for two boys.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Lorring—”</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” the big hand came up again.
“The point that I am going to make is this: You
can’t borrow money here with the specific idea of
starting up a pickle factory. However, having confidence
in you, because of past associations, I’m willing
to advance you five hundred dollars on a thirty-day
note at six per cent, to enable you to swing this
pickle deal and thus save yourself from loss. If you
find in selling your pickles that you have what
would seem to be the nucleus of another industry,
that will be taken up separately, by the proper
people. Just give this slip to the cashier as you go
out and your account will be credited accordingly.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred and thirty-two dollars,” says
Poppy, looking at our new bank balance when we
were in the street. “It isn’t going to be a cent too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
much. Do you know what seven hundred bushels
of pickled cucumbers ought to bring?”</p>

<p>“How much?” says I.</p>

<p>“Anywhere from seven thousand to eight thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>This high finance, or whatever you call it, was
almost too much for me.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says I, sort of anxious-like, “aren’t we
getting in gosh-awful deep?”</p>

<p>“The deeper the better,” says he. “For then we
can high-dive in perfect safety.”</p>

<p>“We may ‘high-dive,’” says I, “and never come
up.”</p>

<p>But he was too bubbly inside to be troubled by
me.</p>

<p>“Now,” says he, starting off down the street, “let’s
see what the Ladies’ Aid has got to say.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” says I, keeping pace with him,
“are we still going to use that ‘Aunt Jemima’ name?”</p>

<p>“No,” he shook his head. “‘Aunt Jemima’ took
too hard a flop ever to get her wind back. So far
as we are concerned the old lady is dead and
buried.”</p>

<p>“‘Poppy’s Pickles,’” I showed my stuff. “That’s
a good name.”</p>

<p>“Jerry, did you ever hear of pedigreed cows?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a fact that <i>pedigreed</i> is the mark of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
quality in cows, horses, dogs and almost everything
else?”</p>

<p>“Even nanny goats,” I nodded.</p>

<p>“All right,” says he, “we’re going to manufacture
pedigreed pickles. Or, if you think it’ll help to
stretch the name out, we’ll call them ‘Poppy’s Pedigreed
Pickles.’ That’s what they are—pickles with
a pedigree. For you heard what Mrs. O’Mally said
about her recipe having been handed down in the
family for a hundred years or more. There’s where
the <i>pedigreed</i> part comes in. It’s a <i>proven</i> recipe,
in other words. The quality of the pickles is guaranteed.
Do you like the name, Jerry?”</p>

<p>I beamed at him.</p>

<p>“Do I like it? Kid, I’m crazy over it.” Then,
running off into my usual line of bunk, I got in
some big gestures. “What a difference one day
makes in the history of the world,” I orationed.
“Yesterday pickles were pickles. But to-day pickles
aren’t pickles unless they’re Pedigreed Pickles....
Let’s send a telegram to Mr. Heinz, telling him that
we’re in the pickle business, too,” I wound up.
“Maybe he’ll be so scared that he’ll beg us to buy
him out at two cents on the dollar.”</p>

<p>Putting all nonsense aside, though, I saw that old
Poppy had a real idea. The job now was to make
it work.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>DARK DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span>—three days passed. And were Poppy and
I ever the busy little bees! Oh, boy! We were
here, there and everywhere, with the president of
the Ladies’ Aid pulling our coat tails one minute
for more cucumbers and the kid from the Western
Union office zigzagging after us the next with a
peck of reply telegrams from keg foundries, bottle
factories, and I don’t know what all. There were
trips to the printing shop, too, where we were
having labels printed, small ones for bottles and
big ones, printed in red and green, for the ten-gallon
kegs that were being zipped to us by fast freight.
Between jobs Poppy squeezed out a business letter,
which later on was run off in quantities at the printing
office and then mailed to wholesale grocers all
over the state.</p>

<p>Poppy’s Pedigreed Pickles! With so much lively
pickle making going on in town, which, of course,
created wide talk, and with so much mail going out
of town, it seemed to me that everybody within a
radius of a thousand miles ought to know about our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
wonderful new pickles. I felt pretty big, let me tell
you. For here we were with twenty women working
for us. And us nothing but boys! It was a
feather in our cap, all right. I was crazy, too, to
get the kegs filled, so that we could do the shipping
act. For then, of course, the money would
come rolling in. Merrily we roll along, roll along,
roll along! The little old jack couldn’t roll in any
too fast to suit me. How wonderful it was to be
rich!</p>

<p>During these helter-skelter days there were moments
when I stopped, winded, to sort of stare at
Poppy in appreciative wonderment. That kid! No
matter what came up he always seemed to know just
what to do and how to do it. It was his earnest
lingo in the first place that had won Mother over
to our scheme, and through her the other members
of the Ladies’ Aid. If we took in a total of eight
thousand dollars, he said, in presenting the proposition
to them, that would mean eight hundred dollars
for the church. So, finding that the Commercial
Bank was backing us, which proved that our
scheme wasn’t just a crazy kid notion, there was a
general call throughout the Methodist circles for
workers, and by the time our first wagonload of
cucumbers was delivered at the church kitchen
twenty women were there to do the receiving act.</p>

<p>As Mrs. O’Mally was now kept busy at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
church from eight in the morning till five in the
afternoon, Uncle Abner took charge of the picking.
And, boy, oh, boy, did the cucumbers ever roll in!
Bushels and bushels and bushels of them! As I
have explained, they first had to be soaked in salt
water for two days, and at one time Poppy and I
counted two hundred and fifteen borrowed tubs in
the church basement, every one of which was filled
to the brim. It began to look as though the workers
would have to start parking filled tubs upstairs
in front of the pulpit. Then the kegs arrived, in
the nick of time, and as fast as they were filled we
piled them outside at the curb. One old lady in
passing was horrified by the thought that they were
beer kegs. Can you imagine! Later the filled kegs
were trucked to a barn near Poppy’s place, which
we called our “warehouse.”</p>

<p>We also opened our store, putting Tom in charge.
His first job was to get rid of the other junk on the
shelves, after which the glass jars were washed
clean and filled with new pickles.</p>

<p>In starting out in the pickle business our original
plan had been to sell only in Tutter. But now, with
such a tremendous wad of pickles on our hands, and
more coming, we realized that we had to reach out
for a wider market. And that is why Poppy had
written to the Illinois wholesalers.</p>

<p>Over four hundred dollars of our money had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
paid out. And every mail brought us a bill for
something or other. But to our great disappointment
the orders that we had expected didn’t come
in. Even worse, the one order that Poppy had
gotten in Rockford was canceled.</p>

<p>What was wrong? Was the Pennykorn gang
bucking us with some secret influence that we didn’t
know about? Poppy got his Rockford cousin on
the telephone, thus learning that the canning company
had written to all of their dealers, warning
them against our pickles. Later Henny sent us the
letter. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Wiggins &amp; Wakefield,<br>
Rockford, Ill.<br>
<br>
Gentlemen:</p>

<p>It is our duty, we feel, to inform you that a
somewhat absurd attempt has been made in
Tutter, by two inexperienced boys, to start
up a rival pickle concern.</p>

<p>You, of course, can imagine what kind of
“pickles” two boys would make! To us,
though, it is not a humorous situation, for
we feel, owing to their use of the “Tutter”
name, that you and other dealers, whose
good will we value highly, might confuse the
new product with ours.</p>

<p>Enclosed is a newspaper clipping, secured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
through the courtesy of the Chicago Daily
Tribune, which pertains to a recent local
epidemic of ptomaine poisoning. We are
unwilling, of course, to state openly that the
so-called “pedigreed pickles” now being
canned by these misguided boys were responsible
for the community poisoning.
However, as the boys scattered samples of
their “pickles” throughout town on the same
day the poisoning developed, you can draw
your own conclusion.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">At your service as always,</span><br>
<span class="indentright2">The Tutter Canning Company,</span><br>
Foreman Pennykorn, President.</p>
</div>

<p>You can see how unfair the letter was. It made
out that our pickles had poisoned the people, which
wasn’t so. From start to finish it was nothing but
a sort of lie.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says I, “I guess we’re done for.”</p>

<p>But while the leader was worried, as his face
showed, he had no thought of giving up.</p>

<p>“It could be worse, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Pickles and debts,” I further sweat. “They’re
going to smother us.”</p>

<p>“How many kegs have we in stock?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and twenty.”</p>

<p>“That’s twelve hundred gallons. They’re easily
worth one-fifty a gallon. So that gives us eighteen
hundred dollars in quick assets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“We aren’t talking about assets,” says I. “We’re
talking about pickles.”</p>

<p>“Pickles are assets in this case. The point is,
Jerry, that we have a stock of pickles worth eighteen
hundred dollars. Our debts are around five
hundred dollars. So we aren’t in such terribly bad
shape as you imagine. If necessary, we’ll carry
samples of our pickles direct to the retail trade, so
that the grocers will see exactly what they’re buying.
It will take longer to sell our stock that way.
But I think we can do it. And later on—”</p>

<p>“What then?” says I, when he paused, with a
sort of hard look on his face.</p>

<p>“It’s a long lane, Jerry,” says he, thinking of the
crooked Pennykorn bunch, “that hasn’t a turn.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t so perked up by this encouraging talk
as you might imagine. And when Poppy filled a
a suit case with samples and went away that afternoon
on a selling trip, I felt like a deserted sailor
on a sinking ship. I knew now why an old dog, in
dying, always tried to crawl off into some dark
corner. Death being a sort of disgrace, it wanted
to get out of its master’s sight. So did I! And to
think that only a few hours ago I had patted myself
on the back. Oh, gee! If we never had gotten
into this awful mess. How crazy we had been to
think that we could buck a hundred-thousand-dollar
corporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Tom, as I say, was running the store, which, with
steadily increasing business, was picking up several
dollars a day. And out in the country Uncle Abner
was still bossing the pickers, who seemingly were
working harder than ever. The Methodist ladies, I
noticed, were beginning to lose their enthusiasm.
Then, to completely knock the props out from
under me, a strange farmer pulled up to the church
with a huge wagonload of cucumbers. He was glad
to know that we were paying two dollars a bushel,
he sort of beamed at me. And he had decided to
let us have his entire crop, of which two more wagon-loads
were now on the way to town.</p>

<p>“No!” I cried, getting my voice. “Take them
over to the canning factory. We don’t want them.”</p>

<p>“Look here, young feller,” he began to bristle,
“you kain’t go back on your word that way.”</p>

<p>“What?” I squeaked, going cold. “Did Poppy
order cucumbers from <i>you</i>, too?”</p>

<p>“When I was comin’ by Miz O’Mally’s farm
I stopped in, to git a peek at her patch. An’ your
man out thar—the one with the whiskers—said if
I’d bring my cucumbers here, an’ stand by you in
your scheme of buckin’ the cannin’ company, you’d
pay me two dollars a bushel. So here they be.”</p>

<p>I started to argue with him. I tried to tell him
that Uncle Abner had no right to buy the cucumbers.
As it was, I said, we had a hundred times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
more cucumbers than we could use. But I might
just as well have shoved my gab at a brick wall.
He unloaded the cucumbers right there in front
of my eyes. A pile as high as my head! No wonder
a sweating pickle maker fainted dead away
when she groped her way out of the kitchen for a
breath of fresh air and saw what was ahead of her.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I told the farmer. He declared
afterwards that I said we’d pay him at the
end of the week. Anyway, he drove off. And
there I was! Nor could I wire Poppy to come home
and help me. For I didn’t know whether he was
in Joliet or Peoria, though, to that point, I expected
a letter from him in the afternoon mail which undoubtedly
would contain his address.</p>

<p>Down the street two more cucumber wagons had
come into sight, and hearing a buzz of excited voices
in the church basement, as the recovering fainter
began talking, I decided that the best thing for me
to do was to dig out.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” Tom told me, when I dragged myself
wearily into the Pickle Parlor, “Mr. Pennykorn
wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“What?” I stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“He stopped in here a few minutes ago. Talked
as nice as pie, too. So you better run over and find
out what he’s got up his sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” I sweat, “and get my beezer knocked off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Bu-lieve me, I know that old bird, all right.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! He wouldn’t dare to lay a finger on
you even if he wanted to. You ought to know
that.”</p>

<p>The last time I had talked with Mr. Pennykorn
his eyes had blazed with hatred. But now, on meeting
him in his office, he purred over me like an old
pussy cat.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says he, when I was seated, “that
you’re wondering why I sent for you.”</p>

<p>I nodded. I guess I was pretty stiff about it, too.
For I couldn’t forget about that crooked letter.</p>

<p>“The—ah—point is,” he got down to business,
“we have a market for cucumber pickles, but no
new stock, largely due, of course, to your interference.
On the other hand, as I understand the
situation, you have a sizable stock but no market.
So it would seem to me, putting aside all past differences
that the thing for us to do is to get together
in a friendly way. And here is my proposition:
We will take over your entire pickle stock,
assume all your debts, reimburse you for the money
that you have paid out of your own pockets, absorb
all your ordered raw stock, and, in addition, as an
indication of our good faith, write a personal check
for you in the amount of two hundred dollars—this,
of course, in the event that the plan meets with
your approval.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Oh, boy, what a relief! Now we could get out
from under, as the saying is, without losing a penny.
Better, still, we’d be two hundred dollars to the
good. Crooked as he had been with us, I was willing
to forgive him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get Poppy on long distance,” says
I, when he brought out a contract for me to sign.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” says he in that nice pussy-cat
way.</p>

<p>“But we’re partners.”</p>

<p>“Your separate signature is binding.”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sign,” I held off, “unless Poppy
knows about it.”</p>

<p>“This is a very generous offer, everything considered,”
says he in a peculiarly steady voice. His
eyes, too, were peculiar. Sort of deep and dangerous-like.
“For your own good,” he added, “I would
urge its immediate acceptance.”</p>

<p>I got up.</p>

<p>“No,” I further shook my head, backing toward
the door. “I won’t sign the paper unless Poppy
says so. I’ll try and locate him right away. I—I
think it will be all right, Mr. Pennykorn. I want
to sign it. And I think he’ll tell me to go ahead.
Just as soon as I get word from him I’ll let you
know.”</p>

<p>As I was going out I met young smarty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Had to come to time, huh?” he sneered.</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything. But I was glad all of a
sudden, as I shot a black look at him, that I hadn’t
signed the paper. However, that feeling was short
lived. For I realized what would happen to us if
we didn’t sign. They weren’t through with us. Mr.
Pennykorn’s actions had said so as plain as words.
He was giving us a last chance. And, bu-lieve me,
I wasn’t going to let that chance get away from me.</p>

<p>Telling Tom what was in the wind, I lit out for
the post office. But the expected letter wasn’t there.
However, a telegram was handed to me shortly before
four o’clock.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sold ten gallons to Chicago grocer. Will be
home to-night at eight-thirty with order.</p>

<p class="right">Poppy.</p>
</div>

<p>Ten gallons! <i>Some</i> order. I was surprised that
Poppy had mentioned it in the telegram. Maybe,
though, I figured out, this was just his way of
breaking the news to me that his selling trip had
been a fizzle.</p>

<p>I got Mr. Pennykorn on the telephone. And it
was arranged that I was to meet Poppy at the train
and take him directly to the bank, where the contract
was to be signed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>POPPY SPRINGS A SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Starting</span> down the street, after having telephoned
to Mr. Pennykorn from the Western Union office,
as I have written down in the conclusion of the
preceding chapter, I was overtaken by a kid who
had a note for me from the president of the Ladies’
Aid. I was to come over to the church right away,
the note said, as the “committee” wanted to talk
with me on important business.</p>

<p>What I did, instead of obeying the note, was to
sneak up an alley and hide in Mr. Weckler’s apple
orchard. Any old time you’d catch me going over
to the church to “talk business” with that bunch
of buzzing women. They were up on their ear, of
course, over the farmer’s cucumbers, of which the
other two loads were probably piled in front of the
door. And what they wanted to do was to jump
on my neck. Gosh all Friday! I had tried to head
the farmer off. But he wouldn’t listen to me. So
it wasn’t my fault.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennykorn could talk to them a whole lot
better than I could. Or better than Poppy, either,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
for that matter. For he was a business man. So
the thing for me to do, I wisely decided, was to
keep out of sight until the paper had been signed.
That would make the banker responsible. Paying
them off, as he had agreed to do, the mountain of
cucumbers would then be hauled over to the canning
factory and everything would be lovely. Mrs.
O’Mally would get her money, too. As for the
farmer, I should worry about him. My hope was
that I’d never see him again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clayton caught sight of me from the back
porch.</p>

<p>“Why, Jerry Todd!” says she in surprise.
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Hiding,” I pushed out a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“Hiding?” she repeated, searching my face.
“Are you in trouble?”</p>

<p>I told her then about the mess that we had made
of our pickle business.</p>

<p>“You poor boy,” she laughed. “You certainly
are in hot water.”</p>

<p>“How is Mr. Weckler?” I inquired, when she had
invited me into the house.</p>

<p>“Getting along very nicely. His mind is still
somewhat clouded, but we all feel joyful in the
knowledge that it will completely clear up in time.”</p>

<p>“Has he told you yet who hit him?”</p>

<p>“No,” she shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“We think we’ve got the guy spotted, Mrs. Clayton.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“He’s hiding in the ‘Weir jungle’ near the river.
And if we once wind up this crazy pickle mess we’ll
probably go in after him.”</p>

<p>“But hadn’t you ought to let the law do that?”
says she, with a worried look.</p>

<p>“We have a special reason for wanting to do it
ourselves,” I told her, thinking, of course, of the
still hidden treasure and the help that the
peculiarly informed man probably could be to us
in its recovery.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you and Poppy ought to attempt
it alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I let the cat out of the bag, “there’s four
of us now.”</p>

<p>“<i>Four</i> of you?” she repeated the number, looking
at me curiously.</p>

<p>I almost had to tell her then who the other two
were. And why not? Tom hadn’t said that we
were to keep his identity a secret.</p>

<p>“Did you know, Mrs. Clayton,” I began, “that
Mr. Weckler has a grandson?”</p>

<p>She stared.</p>

<p>“A <i>grandson</i>?” Then she searched my face to
see if I were in earnest. “Why, Jerry, you must be
mistaken. For if Mr. Weckler has a grandson he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
surely would have mentioned it to me. I’ve been
here for years.”</p>

<p>“We told Tom that his grandpa didn’t know
about him,” I waggled. “But he flew up, hot-tempered.
According to the story he tells, his
mother wrote home for help, when she was down
and out, and the letter never was answered. So,
in a way, you can’t blame the kid for being sore.
I’d feel the same way, I guess, if it had been my
mother.”</p>

<p>“Jerry!” came the further cry. “Are you talking
about Mr. Weckler’s daughter?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be bully,” says I, “if we could bring
Tom and his grandpa together. For the kid needs
a home. And Mr. Weckler probably would be glad
to have him here.”</p>

<p>Getting the whole story, Mrs. Clayton began crying,
so great was her joy. If the daughter <i>had</i> written
home for help, the letter never had been delivered,
the housekeeper declared.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she concluded, dabbing at her eyes. And
there was a look on her face that made me think
of summer sunshine. “Mr. Weckler will be <i>so</i>
happy. For he had mourned over his lost daughter
for years. I know, too, that he has tried hard to
find her, but without success.”</p>

<p>We talked then of how we could bring the kid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and his grandpa together. And learning that the
grandson was tending store for us, less than a block
away, Mrs. Clayton excitedly put on her hat and
hurried down the street. But in her eagerness to
see him she had no intention, of course, of saying
anything to him about our plans. It was too soon.
Afterwards I got a kick out of Tom’s story of how
a queer-acting customer breezed into the store, and
instead of giving an order stood looking at him as
though she wanted to jump over the counter and
hug him. As a matter of fact, I suspect that Mrs.
Clayton <i>did</i> want to hug him. Women are that
way. And all wrapped up in Mr. Weckler, she was
thinking, of course, of the happy days that were
coming, with an old man’s mind at ease, and a
young heir stationed in the home of his people
where he belonged.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock I skinned out for the depot.
And pretty soon the train pulled in. Poppy got his
eyes on me as he came down the steps with his
suit case. And I didn’t have to take a second look
at him to know that his selling trip had been a fizzle,
as I had suspected from the telegram. For his
downcast face told the story. So, as soon as we
got together, I hurriedly dished out to him the good
news of Mr. Pennykorn’s unexpected offer. By
signing the paper, I ran on, we’d get our money
back and two hundred dollars to boot. More than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
that, there would be a general squaring-up all
round.</p>

<p>“Lovely,” says Poppy, as we hurried down the
street, “if—”</p>

<p>“If what?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a nigger in the fence.”</p>

<p>“Everything will be put down in black and
white,” I tried to quiet his suspicions. “So we’ll
know exactly what we’re signing.”</p>

<p>“And all we get clear is two hundred dollars,
huh?”</p>

<p>I stared at him.</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night! Under the circumstances I think
we’re lucky to get that.”</p>

<p>“The pickles are worth eighteen hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“To them—yes. But not to us.”</p>

<p>“Evidently,” mused Poppy, “the old geezer must
want our pickles pretty badly to come chasing after
us.”</p>

<p>“I think he’s very generous,” says I.</p>

<p>“Don’t be simple, Jerry. He hates us like a cat
hates vinegar. And much less than wanting to do
us a good turn, as you think, he’d squeeze us to the
wall in a minute, if he got the chance.”</p>

<p>The sweat began to stream down my face as I
saw ruin ahead.</p>

<p>“Poppy, let me ask a favor of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Shoot.”</p>

<p>“Whatever else you do to-night at the bank, don’t
fly off the handle. I know he’s done us dirt. And
I know, too, that he hasn’t any love for us. But,
kid, we’ve got to face the fact that we’re licked.
There’s no getting around that. Smart as we are,
his money and influence have been too much for us.
And if you shoot it back at him, and make him mad,
he may close up like a clam and leave us in the
lurch.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do,” says Poppy, “lick
his hand?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to knuckle down to him. It’s as bitter
to me, of course, as it is to you. But we’ve simply
<i>got</i> to do it. There’s no getting out of it. Anyway,”
I held up the brighter side, “we’ll be richer
by two hundred dollars. And Mrs. O’Mally will
get her two-dollar price. So we haven’t so terribly
much to feel blue about. Then, too, there’s the
treasure.”</p>

<p>Stopping in front of the police station, Poppy
rubbered through the screen door.</p>

<p>“Wait here,” says he, going inside, where he exchanged
a few quick words with Bill Hadley, who,
in reply, laughed and nodded. Had my mind been
less jammed full of uneasiness, I might have been
curious. But just then the more important thought
to me was what would happen to us if Poppy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
temper did get away from him at the bank. Going
to the wall, sort of, in bankruptcy, would Dad have
to step in and foot my half of the losses? It was
a sickening thought.</p>

<p>There was a light in the bank. And seeing two
automobiles parked at the curb, one of which was
the grandson’s snappy little roadster, we weren’t
surprised, on being admitted, to find the whole
family there.</p>

<p>“Have a seat,” says young Pennykorn, as lordly-like
as you please, “and we’ll get down to business.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Poppy complied dryly.</p>

<p>The kid, it seemed, was going to do the talking.
His grandfather and father apparently had made
that arrangement with him. For they sat back in
silence.</p>

<p>“I suppose young Todd has told you about the
contract.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He was in our office this afternoon and Grandpop
made him an offer.”</p>

<p>Poppy nodded.</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” says he, “you want to take
over our entire pickle stock.”</p>

<p>“We’re willing to do that.”</p>

<p>“Also you want to take over our entire cucumber
stock.”</p>

<p>“If we close a deal with you for the pickles,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
kid admitted, “we’ll also take over the cucumbers.”</p>

<p>“And you agree to pay all of our debts, totaling
that with a bonus of two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s our proposition.”</p>

<p>Poppy sort of turned up his nose.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says he, “that you think it’s a fair
proposition ... for us.”</p>

<p>Smarty stiffened, his cheeks puffing out.</p>

<p>“Fair?” he shot back angrily. “It’s a blamed
sight fairer than you deserve. If I had my way—”</p>

<p>“Forrest,” came blandly from the banker, “unless
you can handle this matter without losing your
temper your father or I shall step in.”</p>

<p>Poppy picked up the conversation.</p>

<p>“I take it for granted,” says he, “that you know
what you’re getting for your money.”</p>

<p>“We’ve checked over your stock, if that’s what
you mean.”</p>

<p>“What do you figure the stock is worth?”</p>

<p>“Why ask us?” evaded the kid. “You own it.”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” says Poppy, “if your
estimate is as high as ours.”</p>

<p>The banker cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“They are unproven pickles,” he spoke up. “So
it would be—ah—absurd to give them a high
valuation.”</p>

<p>“If you’re in doubt about them,” came the shot,
“why do you want them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>The banker colored.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully hot in here,” Poppy mopped his
face with his handkerchief. Then he got up and
opened a window, through which we could hear the
evening traffic in Main Street. “There,” he drew a
deep breath, “that’s better.”</p>

<p>Smarty was glaring.</p>

<p>“You’ve got your nerve.”</p>

<p>“Sit down and shut up,” says Poppy, “before I
shut you up.” Then he wheeled and faced the
banker. “It’s plain to me now why you wrote that
lying letter about us. It was a scheme to tie up our
stock. And now you think you can buy our pickles
at your own terms.”</p>

<p>The banker’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“You had better curb your tongue, young
man.”</p>

<p>“Oh!...” Poppy’s eyes blazed. “You’d like
to shut me up, would you? You don’t like to have
me tell you to your face what a crooked piece of
work that letter was. Glare at me, if you want to.
I’m not afraid of you. As it happens I’ve been out
in the field talking with your wholesalers. And I
know why you want our pickle stock. You’re in a
hole. You’ve booked orders that you can’t fill.
And you’re trying now to buy our pickles to save
yourself. Well, let me tell you something—you
aren’t going to get a single pickle from us. Nor a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
single cucumber, either. Put that in your pipe and
smoke it.”</p>

<p>Smarty started forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll knock your block off!”</p>

<p>But the banker called for silence.</p>

<p>“Young man,” says he in an icy voice, “you’re
a fool. For no one but a fool, caught as you are,
would impertinently turn down an offer such as
we have made you. You have just one more
chance—”</p>

<p>“To do what?—sign your paper?”</p>

<p>“Here it is. As a matter of fact,” came steely-like,
“we <i>do</i> need your pickles. And what’s more,
we’re going to get them. For you’re going to sign
this paper before you leave here.”</p>

<p>Click! went the key in the lock.</p>

<p>“They can’t get out now, Grandpop.”</p>

<p>The banker held out a pen.</p>

<p>“Sign,” he commanded, and as I got a look at his
glittering eyes all I could think of was a snake.</p>

<p>But instead of taking the pen, Poppy stepped
quickly to the open window.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Bill,” he spoke to some one outside.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Poppy,” says Bill Hadley.</p>

<p>“Nice evening.”</p>

<p>“Swell,” drawled Bill. “Full moon, I notice.”</p>

<p>“Say, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Yep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“If you aren’t in any hurry just stick around for
a few minutes longer. Will you?”</p>

<p>I saw now why Poppy had stopped at the police
station. He had suspected that an attempt would
be made to force us to sign the paper. And how
slick of him to get the window open without exciting
the enemy’s suspicion!</p>

<p>The banker had to do considerable gulping before
he found his voice.</p>

<p>“Unlock the door, Forrest,” says he hoarsely.
“You shouldn’t have locked it in the first place.”</p>

<p>Poppy stopped in the doorway.</p>

<p>“By the way,” says he sweetly, “I forgot to tell
you that we couldn’t have signed your paper anyway.
For this afternoon when I was in Chicago I
not only sold every pickle that we’ve got in stock,
but I further got orders for all we can make in the
next six weeks.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” thundered the banker. “No boy
could do it.”</p>

<p>“You would be doing boys an injustice,” was
Poppy’s parting shot, “if you were to judge them
all by your grandson.”</p>

<small>IN THE SHADOW OF THE CHIMNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as we hit the street I weaved over to
the curb and collapsed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” grinned old surprise package.
“Are you tired?”</p>

<p>“Kid,” I recovered my voice, “I’m paralyzed
with joy. Is it true?”</p>

<p>For answer he subtracted a sheaf of orders from
his inside coat pocket.</p>

<p>“It was easy, Jerry, after I once got on the right
track.”</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says I, loving him with my eyes,
“you’re a wonder.”</p>

<p>“Aw!... Cut out the ‘wonder’ stuff,” he
shrugged, “and let’s lasso a couple of sandwiches.
For I haven’t had my supper yet.”</p>

<p>“You ought to write a book,” I further bragged
on him.</p>

<p>“A cook book?” he grinned.</p>

<p>“No. A book on selling. For you surely know
how to do it. Who was the first victim to come
under your hypnotic influence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“One of the railroad officials.”</p>

<p>“Conductor?”</p>

<p>“No. President.”</p>

<p>“What?” I squeaked. Yet, knowing him so well,
I shouldn’t have been surprised.</p>

<p>He dropped down beside me.</p>

<p>“It’s funny, Jerry,” says he, “what queer ideas
a fellow gets about big business men. I always pictured
a railroad president as a towering, square-shouldered,
high-pressure man with a foghorn voice
and sixteen jumping secretaries. But Mr. Lorrimer
wasn’t that kind of a man at all. In fact, when I
found out that he was the president of the railroad
you could have knocked me over with a feather.
And did I ever feel silly for a minute or two! For
I had been razzing his pickles.”</p>

<p>I didn’t get that.</p>

<p>“We were in the dining car,” Poppy then explained
more fully. “Me on one side of the small
table and little snappy eyes on the other side. I
noticed that the waiters gave him a lot of attention.
But, as I say, I never dreamed that he was the
president of the railroad. Looked to me more like
the proprietor of a peanut stand, or something like
that. We talked back and forth. Then some
cucumber pickles were brought in. They weren’t
much, I said, thinking of our own swell pickles.
That kind of ruffled little what’s-his-name. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
to tell him then who I was, after which he sent the
waiter to get my sample case. Then, finding that
my pickles were everything that I had claimed for
them, he called in another man, who turned out to
be the food buyer for the railroad. ‘Samson,’ says
he, ‘this boy has something we need in connection
with our dining-car service. Look into his proposition,
please. And see what can be done.’”</p>

<p>“And then,” says I, anticipating the story’s ending,
“is when the big order was shoved at you,
huh?”</p>

<p>“I got an order,” he nodded. “But it wasn’t so
very big. Only six ten-gallon kegs.”</p>

<p>I searched his face.</p>

<p>“But you said in the bank that you had sold our
entire stock.”</p>

<p>“And so I have ... but the railroad company
didn’t buy the big bulk of it, though, to that point,
we probably will get bigger orders from them when
they learn that we’re dependable. Getting my
story, Mr. Samson asked me why I didn’t try the
big Chicago hotels and restaurants. They bought
tremendous quantities of food, he said, and always
were on the lookout for a ‘special.’ He even gave
me a note of introduction to one buyer. So, instead
of stopping in Joliet, as had been my plan in starting
out I went on into the city. And there, kiddo,
is where I got the big orders. Oh, baby! My only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
worry now is shipments. I’m wondering if we can
make good.”</p>

<p>“And you knew all this,” I gave him a stiff eye,
“when you sent that telegram?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” he grinned. “I thought it would be
fun to throw a scare into you. As a matter of fact,
the order that I mentioned in the telegram is the
smallest of the lot.”</p>

<p>At the restaurant I asked them to bring me a
cup of strong coffee. I felt I needed it. For in
checking over Poppy’s orders I found that they
totaled more than six thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Tom Weir collided with us in front of the hash
house.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking all over town for you.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” says Poppy, noticing how
excited the other was. “Has the cat killer been
after you?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s the gold cucumber.”</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that the cucumber had
been returned to our new chum and his uncle. And
now Tom brought it out of his pocket in two pieces.</p>

<p>“We were looking at it to-night,” he explained,
“trying again to figure out its secret. Dropping it
by accident, Mrs. O’Mally rocked on it. We found
out then that it had been made in halves and put
together with gold rivets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Did anything come out of it?” cried Poppy excitedly.</p>

<p>“No. But if you’ll take this piece closer to the
light you’ll find it’s got a lot of queer marks on it.”</p>

<p>Later I made a drawing of the marks. Here it is:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p230">
<img class="w100" src="images/p230.jpg" alt="drawing">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Poppy studied the pictures, realizing, of course,
that they composed the “key” to the treasure’s hiding
place.</p>

<p>“The first picture,” says he, “is the sun.”</p>

<p>“Either that,” say I, putting my own beezer to
work, “or a full moon.”</p>

<p>“A full moon! That’s it! For pirates always
hid their stuff by moonlight. A gold cucumber
first. Then a full moon. That must mean a full
moon in cucumber time.”</p>

<p>“Lay to it, old Sherlock,” I patted the brainy
one on the back. “You’re getting warmer every
minute.”</p>

<p>“This is a clock,” says Tom, pointing to the second
picture.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” waggled Poppy. “And the hands
point to twelve, which means noon or midnight.”</p>

<p>“Midnight, of course,” I swung in. “For whoever
heard of a full moon in the middle of the
day?”</p>

<p>There was more deep studying.</p>

<p>“I don’t get the third picture,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Looks like soap bubbles,” says I.</p>

<p>“Or a string of magician’s rings,” says Tom.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that it’s a chimney. Those
circles may be smoke rings.”</p>

<p>I gave a yip.</p>

<p>“Sure thing, it’s a chimney,” says I, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
picture of the old stone house in my mind. “And
we know what chimney, too.”</p>

<p>“The last picture is a coffin.”</p>

<p>“Br-r-r-r!” I shimmied. “Let’s hope we don’t
have to tackle any graveyard stuff.”</p>

<p>Tom further studied the third picture.</p>

<p>“Maybe the treasure is hid in the big chimney,”
says he. “And to get it we’ve got to go in from the
top.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the idea of the other pictures?”
puzzled Poppy.</p>

<p>“The only thing a moon does,” says I, “is to
make light. And light makes shadows. So maybe
we’re supposed to dig in the shadow of the chimney,
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Jerry, old pal, that little beezer of yours sure
is popping off steam to-night. Coffins always go in
the ground. So we’re supposed to <i>dig</i>. And the
moon and the chimney tell where to dig.”</p>

<p>We lit out then for the stone house. And up in
the sky was the biggest, fattest moon you ever laid
eyes on. Uncle Abner and Mrs. O’Mally were waiting
up for us, playing the talking machine. Pretty
soon the clock struck midnight. And going outside
we marked off the shadow of the chimney, as it
showed on the ground, and began to dig. It was
hard work. But we never let up, even though we
were blinded by the sweat that streamed down our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
faces. For comfort we took off our coats and shirts.
We now were working in a hole almost four feet
deep. Then, about two o’clock in the morning, we
found it!</p>

<p>Getting the iron chest out of the hole, after a
whale of a lot of pulling and tugging, we whacked
the rusted padlock to pieces with the pick and threw
back the cover. Nor were we disappointed! And,
to that point, I sometimes wonder if another such
peculiar treasure ever was brought to light. Gold
cucumbers! Thousands of them—or so it seemed
to us at the exciting moment.</p>

<p>To-day Poppy and I each have a snug little nest
egg of seven thousand dollars tucked away in Mr.
Lorring’s bank. That was our share of the treasure.
For the gold, of course, was later sold. And
you understand, too, that each of the other three
got the same amount. Thirty-five thousand
dollars! That was the total amount of the treasure.
Not as much as we had expected. But are we kicking?
I hope to snicker we aren’t.</p>

<p>The newspapers all over the state made a big
thing of the recovered treasure. And a reporter
with shell-rimmed glasses and spats came all the
way from Chicago to take pictures. I felt pretty
big when I saw my picture in the newspaper. Right
beside old Peg-leg, too—only, of course, his picture
was made up. And what a picture it was! But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
newspaper story got little attention from Poppy.
Pedigreed Pickles was still the big thing in his mind.
For he had the job now of getting organized for still
heavier production.</p>

<p>I might say in that connection that the Methodist
ladies perked up somewhat when we gave them a
check for one hundred and eighty dollars, which
paid them for the work they had done to date.
Still, though they were willing to go on, we felt that
we had more cucumbers than they could handle.
And not wanting to be partial, just because we were
Methodists, we gave the Presbyterian ladies a
chance to pull a few nails out of their church debt.
Then we put the Catholic ladies to work. Pickles,
pickles, pickles! The town was flooded with pickles.
We shipped them out right and left. And how
grand and glorious was the feeling when the little
old checks began to roll in.</p>

<p>We went after the cat killer, too. But before I
write down that part, let me tell you about the banquet
that the Chamber of Commerce put on. Gee!
That was one time, I guess, when old Poppy was
completely knocked off his pins. Every time I
think of the “speech” he made that night I laugh
myself sick.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>GUESTS OF HONOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning shortly after the recovery of the
treasure Mr. Lorring called us into the bank.</p>

<p>“The first thing you young whippersnappers
know,” he lit into us in his booming way, “you’re
going to have a damage suit on your hands.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” says Poppy, kind of anxious-like,
his thoughts, of course, turning instantly to the
canning company.</p>

<p>“WHAT’S WRONG!” came the increased thunder.
“Look at me! I’m wasting away. In one
week I’ve dropped from two-eighty to two-seventy-seven.”</p>

<p>We were grinning now. For we saw that he
wasn’t really huffy. He was just pretending.</p>

<p>“It’s your confounded pickles,” he went on.
“They’re interfering with my domestic affairs. In
the morning my wife is in such a hurry to get over
to the church that she doesn’t half prepare breakfast.
She’s never home at noon. And at night the
cry is that she’s ‘too tired to cook.’ To a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
loves victuals, as I do, this is a hardship. And I’ve
made up my mind to protest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” grinned Poppy. “And the
thing for you to do, Mr. Lorring, as I see it, is to
help us start up a regular pickle factory. Then
we can release the church women, and your wife
will do her cooking at home.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” the gray eyes twinkled. “A pickle factory,
heh? Think you can make a go of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we can’t.”</p>

<p>“Would it surprise you,” Mr. Lorring then looked
at us curiously, “to know that yesterday afternoon
I had a long talk with Mr. Foreman Pennykorn?”</p>

<p>“About us?” says Poppy quickly, his voice
touched with uneasiness. For he realized, of
course, that we had been called into the bank on
a matter of importance.</p>

<p>“Partly. But our talk was mostly about pickles
and community interests. Now, I know how you
boys feel toward the canning company. It’s your
idea that they gave you a crooked deal, and so
you’ve got it in for them. On the other hand they’re
equally bitter toward you, because of your interference.
So, in a way, it’s six of one against a half
dozen of the other. And any sensible concession
from their side ought to be matched by a similar
concession from your side. That’s good business.
Naturally, under the circumstances, you want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
further buck them by starting up a pickle factory
of your own. And if you decide to go ahead on that
plan, getting financial backing elsewhere, I can’t
stop you. But I’m not sure that it would be the
best thing for you to do, or, even more important,
the best thing for the town. You might make a
success of your new factory; then again you might
not. Everything is all right so far. And, to that
point, you deserve a great deal of credit for what
you’ve done, Poppy in particular. As you boys
probably realize, I think a great deal of you. I’m
proud of you, in fact. You’re just the kind of up-and-coming
boys we need. So, keep it up. It’s good
for you and also good for the community. To get
back to the pickle proposition, though, I have been
asked by Mr. Pennykorn to use my influence to
bring you and the canning company together.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Poppy, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“And why not?” came steadily.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t know everything they’ve done,
Mr. Lorring. For if you did you’d realize how impossible
it is for us ever to tie up with them.”</p>

<p>“Outside of the fact that you have a boyish
hatred for them, are you afraid they’ll skin
you?”</p>

<p>“They would if they got a chance.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I make it my business, as your
older friend, to see that they never get such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
chance—though, to that point, I haven’t much
doubt of their honesty.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” says Poppy, more quietly.</p>

<p>“Here’s the proposition that Mr. Pennykorn
asked me to put before you: They want to organize
a separate pickle branch. As you know,
they talked of buying a plant in Ashton. But the
local Chamber of Commerce has talked them out of
that notion. And they have agreed to build the
proposed new plant here <i>if</i> they can immediately
take over your cucumber stock and further get exclusive
manufacturing rights on your ‘Pedigreed
Pickles,’ as a companion line to their ‘Dandy Dills.’
The new company, to call it that, will be capitalized
at one hundred thousand dollars, and common stock,
having a par value of one hundred dollars a share,
will be issued in the amount of sixty thousand
dollars, the balance of the stock to be held in reserve,
as is quite proper. Of the six hundred issued
shares, you boys will be given fifty shares apiece;
Mrs. O’Mally the same. If the stock earns ten per
cent, each one’s share of the yearly earnings will
be five hundred dollars. Also there is the possibility
of greater earnings, which would materially
increase the value of the stock. Personally, I think
it is a very fair proposition. And my advice would
be for you to accept it. Nor need you have any
uncertainty over your position as minority stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
holders. I’ll see that you are properly taken care
of.”</p>

<p>It was then further pointed out to us how much
better the established company could serve the
town than us. So we finally told Mr. Lorring that
we would do whatever he thought was best. In due
time the promised stock was delivered, after which,
of course, the Pennykorns were as nice as pie to
us. I suppose it was best for us to bury the
hatchet. But, to this day, I still feel sort of queer
when I’m around them. I’ll never forget that exciting
night in the bank. I guess they never will,
either. I don’t see how they could.</p>

<p>Having come to a settlement with the canning
company, the public announcement was then made
that ground would soon be broken for a separate
new pickle factory. And in celebration the Chamber
of Commerce got up a swell supper, to which
all of the surrounding farmers were invited. The
word got out, too, that the canning company was
going to issue new contracts, under which they
would agree to pay the farmers the highest market
prices for their stuff. That, of course, made everybody
happy. So it was a lively bunch that turned
out to the big feed, with the Tutter band doing
the tooting stuff and the big hall all dolled up in
fancy paper streamers. Poppy and I were there,
for they couldn’t very well leave us out. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
guess it was Mr. Lorring’s doings that we got places
at the head table, where the big basket of artificial
fruit was. Boy, oh, boy, did we ever light into that
grub! Then, at the invitation of the master of
ceremonies, or whatever you call him, several
prominent business men made short speeches about
“the most progressive little city in the middle west,”
after which came a long-winded introduction.</p>

<p>“And so,” the master of ceremonies wound up,
“it is my great pleasure, fellow boosters, to introduce
one of the guests of honor, who, young as he
is, has literally swept the nation off its feet. Seven-League
Stilts! We all know who invented them.
We know, too, who’s responsible for this clever
‘Pedigreed Pickles’ idea.... Let’s have a few
words from Poppy Ott.”</p>

<p>Gee-miny Christmas! Poppy and I almost
fainted. Guests of honor! We were it and never
had suspected it! Finally, though, I got some of
my senses back.</p>

<p>“Get up,” I kicked old dumb-bell under the
table. “They’re calling on you.”</p>

<p>Well, he got up—though it took him a long time
to do it. He was kind of white, too, like the time
he ate the green apples. And, oh, gee, how proud
I was of him! <i>My</i> pal! The bulliest pal in the
whole world! A few months ago he was a tramp.
And now see him. Good old Poppy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Everything was deadly still. For everybody was
waiting to hear the speech. Presently Poppy sat
down. And then you should have heard the applause!
Afterwards he asked me, kind of sheepish-like,
what he had said. And did I ever <i>laugh</i>! For
the funny part is that he <i>never said a word</i>!</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hardly need to tell you that Tom
and his recovered grandpa were brought together.
And was that ever a joyful meeting for the old
gentleman. Tom now lives in the old-fashioned
house near the canning factory. He’s crazy over
our Pickle Parlor and I imagine that we’ll sell out
to him in time, as the building and lot are his, anyway.
You’ll smile when I tell you that Uncle Abner
and Mrs. O’Mally got married. As for old Butch,
he got a steady job up the canal and never came
back.</p>

<p>Picking up the story of Tom’s father, Nathan
Weir wasn’t dead, as his family had supposed, but
for years he had been in the Ohio state penitentiary,
where he had been taken following a robbery in
which he had been shot in the arm. Blood poison
setting in, the arm was later taken off. His wife
had died, and from his long absence it was concluded
that he was dead, too. Getting out of the
penitentiary, he had come back to Rimtown, finding
his father dead and the family scattered.
After that he got mixed up in a jewel robbery in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Peoria, and to hide from the law he came to Tutter,
knowing about the old tunnel—and what was his
amazement to find his brother and son living near
the pirate’s old home in a cave! Learning about
the gold cucumber, from listening, he had stolen
it, thinking that it would give him the “key” to the
treasure’s hiding place. Failing in this, he finally
decided to lay low and secretly grab the treasure
when the others had lifted it. His mind was “off,”
or otherwise, in having heard about our “diamonds”
he wouldn’t have broken into Poppy’s cellar. For
he should have known that there was no connection
between our advertised “diamonds” and those of
which he had been robbed by his crooked Peoria
accomplice. Later he got the idea that the diamonds
were in Mr. Weckler’s safe ... yet how
peculiar must have been his feelings to break into
that particular house! No doubt he stepped on the
yellow cat. And in all probability its yowling made
him furious, which would explain why he strangled
it. The “machine” that we had seen at church was
just a contraption that some boy had rigged up.
I think it was Spider Whickleberry. I heard the
kids telling afterwards how slick Spider could pick
off cats. He thought it was fun to catch them and
then let them go.</p>

<p>We found the “cat strangler” living in a hut in
the heart of the willow patch. He was sick. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
two days later he died in the hospital. As he was
Tom’s father, the less we say about him the better.
He’s gone. And that’s enough.</p>

<p>My story comes to an end here. And I can only
hope that you have enjoyed it. Coming soon is
POPPY OTT AND THE FRECKLED GOLDFISH.
Can you imagine a scientist spending his
whole lifetime studying <i>freckles</i>? Professor Aldercott
Pip, A.B., M.A., Ph.D., modestly claimed to be
the best-informed freckle specialist in the world.
But we could hardly credit our ears when we heard
about his marvelous “freckle” dust. Gosh! Then
came the amazing surprise of the freckled goldfish!</p>

<p>It was Poppy, of course, who planned our new
“aquarium” fish store. And was it ever a darb!
In the selling campaign that followed our main
slogan was: “What is home without a freckled
goldfish?” We got up all kinds of nifty schemes.
“You trade in your old-fashioned auto for a new
one,” he told the Tutter people, “so why not trade
in your old-fashioned goldfish and get one of the
up-to-date freckled kind?”</p>

<p>“The book of a million laughs!” That is what
you’ll call it when you’ve read it. And remember,
too, it’s coming soon.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
